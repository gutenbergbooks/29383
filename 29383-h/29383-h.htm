<p>The following pamphlet has been compiled for the purpose of giving
information to those intending to invest in the industries of the
Hawaiian Islands. The information can be vouched for as correct. The
portion dealing with agriculture is from the pen of Joseph Marsden,
Esq., Commissioner of Agriculture. The digest of the land law has been
prepared by J.&nbsp;F. Brown, Esq., Commissioner of Public Lands. The
historical portion has been written by Prof. Alexander, Chief of the
Government Survey and author of a "Short History of the Hawaiian
People" and other works. The pamphlet has been planned, edited and in
part written by Alatau&nbsp;T. Atkinson, Esq., ex-Inspector General of
Schools, and now General Superintendent of Census.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<hr class="mini" />

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION.</h3>

<p>The Hawaiian Islands are situated in the North Pacific Ocean and
lie between longitudes 154°&nbsp;40' and 160°&nbsp;30' West, and
latitudes 22°&nbsp;16' and 18°&nbsp;55' North. They are thus on the
very edge of the tropics, but their position in mid-ocean and the
prevalence of the northeast trade wind gives them a climate unequalled
by any other portion of the globe&mdash;a perpetual summer without an
enervating heat. In the Hawaiian Islands Americans and Europeans can
and do work in the open air, at all seasons of the year, as they
cannot in countries lying in the same latitudes elsewhere. To note an
instance, Calcutta lies a little to the north of the latitude of
Kauai, our most northerly Island, and in Calcutta the American and
European can only work with his brain; hard physical labor he cannot
do and live. On the Hawaiian Islands he can work and thrive.</p>


<h3>RAINFALL AND TEMPERATURE.</h3>

<p>The rainfall varies, being greater on the windward side of the
Islands, and increasing up to a certain elevation. Thus, at Olaa, on
the Island of Hawaii, windward side and elevation of about 2,000 feet,
the rainfall from July 1st, 1894, to June 30, 1895, was 176.82 inches,
while at Kailua, on the leeward side, at a low level, it was only
51.21 inches during the same period.</p>

<p>The temperature also varies according to elevation and position.
<!-- Page 4 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
On the Island of Hawaii you can get any climate from the heat of
summer to actual winter at the summits of the two great mountains. A
meteorological record, kept carefully for a period of twelve years,
gives 89° as the highest and 54° as the lowest temperature recorded,
or a mean temperature of 71°&nbsp;30' for the year. A case of
sunstroke has never been known. People make no special precautions
against the sun, wearing straw and soft felt hats similar to those
worn in the States during the summer months.</p>


<h3>WINDS.</h3>

<p>The prevailing winds, as mentioned above, are the northeast trades.
These blow for about nine months of the year. The remainder of the
period the winds are variable and chiefly from the south. The Islands
are outside the cyclone belt, and severe storms accompanied by thunder
and lightning are of rare occurrence.</p>


<h3>HEALTH.</h3>

<p>The Islands possess a healthy climate. There are no virulent fevers
such as are encountered on the coast of Africa or in the West India
Islands.  Epidemics seldom visit the Islands, and when they do they
are generally light. A careful system of quarantine guards the Islands
now from epidemics from abroad. Such grave diseases as pneumonia and
diphtheria are almost unknown. Children thrive wonderfully.</p>


<h3>AREA.</h3>

<p>For practical purposes&mdash;and these lines are written for
practical men&mdash;there are eight Islands in the Hawaiian group. The
others are mere rocks, of no value to mankind at present. These eight
Islands, beginning from the northwest, are named Niihau, Kauai, Oahu,
Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui and Hawaii. The areas of these Islands
are as follows:</p>

<p>The Islands that interest an intending immigrant are Hawaii, Maui,
Oahu and Kauai. It is on these Islands that coffee, fruits, potatoes,
corn and vegetables can be raised by the small investor, and where
land can be obtained on reasonable terms.</p>


<h3>HAWAII.</h3>

<p>The Island of Hawaii is the largest in the group, and presents
great varieties of soil and climate. The windward side, which includes
the districts of North Kohala, Hamakua, Hilo and Puna, is copiously
watered by rains and, in the Hilo district, the streams rush
impetuously down every gulch or ravine. The leeward side of the
Island, including South Kohala, North and South Kona, and Kau, is not
exposed to such strong rains, but an ample supply of water falls in
the rain belt. The Kona district has given the coffee product a name
in the markets of the world.</p>

<p>On this Island are now situated numerous sugar plantations. Coffee
employs the industry of several hundred owners, ranging from the man
with 200,000 trees to him who has only an acre or so. There are
thousands upon thousands of acres at present uncultivated and only
awaiting the sturdy arms and enterprising brains of the men of the
temperate zone to develop them.</p>


<div>
<!-- Page 6 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
</div>

<h3>MAUI.</h3>

<p>Maui is also a very fine Island. Besides its sugar plantations, it
has numerous coffee lands, especially in the eastern part, which are
just now being opened up. The western slopes of Haleakala, the main
mountain of Maui, are covered with small farms where are raised
potatoes, corn, beans and pigs. Again, here, thousands of acres are
lying fallow.</p>


<h3>HONOLULU.</h3>

<p>On Oahu is the capital, Honolulu. It is a city numbering thirty
thousand inhabitants and is pleasantly situated on the south side of
the Island.  The city extends a considerable distance up Nuuanu Valley
and has wings extending northwest and southeast. It is a city of
foliage. Except in the business blocks, every house stands in its own
garden, and some of the houses are wonderfully beautiful.</p>

<p>The city is lighted with electric light; there is a very complete
telephone system, and tram cars run at short intervals along the
principal streets and continue out to a sea-bathing resort and public
park, four miles from the city. There are numerous stores where all
kinds of goods can be obtained. In this particular Honolulu occupies a
position ahead of any city of similar size. The public buildings are
handsome and commodious. There are numerous churches, schools, a
public library of over 10,000 volumes,
Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. Hall, Masonic Temple, Odd Fellows' Hall and
Theater. There is frequent steam communication with San Francisco,
once a month with Victoria (British Columbia), and twice a month with
New Zealand and the Australian Colonies. Steamers also connect
Honolulu with China and Japan. There are three evening daily papers
published in English, one daily morning paper, and two weeklies.
Besides these there are papers published in the Hawaiian, Portuguese,
Japanese and Chinese languages, and also monthly magazines in various
tongues.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
</div>

<h3>OAHU'S OPPORTUNITIES.</h3>

<p>The Island of Oahu presents excellent opportunities for the
investor.  Acres upon acres of land remain undeveloped among its
teeming valleys, the energies and wealth of the population having been
devoted to the development of the sugar lands on the larger
Islands.</p>

<p>A line of railroad has been constructed which at present runs along
the coast to a distance of thirty miles from the city. It is proposed
to continue this line completely around the Island. This railroad
opens up rich coffee and farming lands and affords ready means of
transport for the produce, and an expeditious method for obtaining the
necessary supplies, etc., from the capital. The management of the
railroad offers special inducements for would-be investors to see the
country, and special rates should they conclude to settle.</p>


<h3>KAUAI.</h3>

<p>Kauai is called the "Garden Island," it is so well watered and so
luxuriant in vegetation. The Island is at present largely devoted to
the cultivation of sugar. Rice also cuts a considerable figure in the
agricultural production of Kauai. That it can produce coffee is
undoubted, but there is a timidity about embarking in the industry,
because some forty years ago the experiment of a coffee plantation was
tried, and owing to misjudgment of location and soil, failed. Since
then the cultivation of coffee has come to be more thoroughly
understood, and there is no doubt that quantities of land suitable for
such cultivation are now lying, like the sleeping beauty, waiting for
the kiss of enterprise to make them awake into usefulness and profit
for mankind.</p>

<p>There is room on the Hawaiian Islands for at least ten times the
present population. The climate, soil and social conditions all tend
to make them a desirable home for those who are willing to work, and
have a moderate capital to begin with.</p>


<div>

</div>

<h3>GOVERNMENT.</h3>

<p>The Government of the Hawaiian Islands is a Republic. Up to the
year 1893 it had been a limited monarchy, but at that date it was
felt, by the progressive party in the state, that monarchy had had its
day, and that the friends of such a form of government should give way
to more liberal institutions, assimilating to the institutions of the
United States, and to become a part of which Great Republic is the
earnest desire of all those who have the interests of the Islands at
heart. The monarchy, in a bloodless revolution, disappeared and the
Republic took its place.</p>

<p>The Republic is a republic of progress, and under the Government
thus established every facility has been given for developing and
improving the country. The President is elected for six years. The
Legislature consists of a Senate and House of Representatives, all
members being elected by popular vote. The Senators are elected for a
term of six years, and voters for Senators must have real property
worth $1,500, or personal property worth $3,000, or an income of not
less than $600 per annum. The vote for Representatives is based on
manhood suffrage.</p>


<h3>TAXATION.</h3>

<p>All males between the ages of 20 and 60 pay a personal tax
of&nbsp;$5, viz: Poll tax,&nbsp;$1; road tax,&nbsp;$2; school
tax,&nbsp;$2. Land pays a tax of one per cent. on the cash value, and
personal property a similar rate. Carts pay&nbsp;$2, brakes&nbsp;$3,
carriages&nbsp;$5, dogs&nbsp;$1, female dogs&nbsp;$3. From the above
it will be seen that the taxes are not heavy as compared with other
countries; moreover, there are no local taxes of any kind.</p>


<h3>METHOD OF ACQUIRING LAND.</h3>

<p>Land can be obtained from the Government by two methods, viz.; The
cash freehold system, and the right of purchase leases.
<!-- Page 9 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Under the first system the land is sold at auction. The purchaser pays
one-quarter in cash and the rest in equal installments of one, two and
three years, interest being charged at the rate of six per cent. upon
the unpaid balance. Under this system the purchaser is bound to
maintain a home on the land from the commencement of the second year
to the end of the third. The right of purchase leases are drawn for
twenty-one years at a rental of eight per cent. on the appraised value
of the land. The lessee has the privilege of purchasing the land,
after the third year, <i>at the original appraised value</i>, provided
25 per cent. of the land is reduced to cultivation, and other
conditions of the lease filled. In this case a home must be maintained
from the end of the first year to the end of the fifth year. The limit
of first-class agricultural land obtainable is 100 acres. This amount
is increased on lands of inferior quality.  Under the above conditions
the applicant must be 18 years of age and obtain special letters of
denization. Land can also be obtained from the various land and
investment companies, and from private parties. The full land law will
be treated of in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter&nbsp;VI</a>. of this
pamphlet.</p>

<h3>JUDICIARY, POLICE, ETC.</h3>

<p>There is a thoroughly efficient judiciary consisting of a Supreme
Court, five Circuit Courts in which trials by jury are conducted, and
District Courts in every district. The higher courts are presided over
by well trained, educated men. There is an efficient police force in
every part of the group. The inhabitants are law-abiding and crimes of
violence are very rare. There is very little petty theft, and even in
Honolulu, the greatest center of population and a seaport town, many
of the houses are left with doors unlocked at night.</p>


<h3>SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p>There is an excellent system of free public schools taught in the
English language, the teachers in many cases being imported
<!-- Page 10 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
from the United States. The main plan of the system is modelled upon
the public school system of the United States, modified to meet the
wants of a heterogeneous population. The children are instructed in
writing, reading, composition, arithmetic, geography, both local and
general. The books are uniform and obtainable at the same price as in
the United States. The schools are strictly non-sectarian. There is no
district, however remote, in which there is no school. The only people
who cannot read and write are those who come from abroad. Those born
in the Islands are compelled by law to take advantage of the education
offered. Besides the common school education, opportunities are given
at various centers for a higher education equivalent to the grammar
grade of the United States, and in Honolulu a high school and
collegiate course can be obtained at a small cost.</p>


<h3>CHURCHES.</h3>

<p>The various Christian denominations are represented and all forms
are tolerated. The country churches of the Protestant denominations
are chiefly conducted by Hawaiian pastors, the Roman Catholic by
French and German priests, who are mostly good linguists and speak
Hawaiian, English and Portuguese, besides their mother
tongue. Wherever there is a large collection of English speaking
people a Protestant church is usually supported by them. In Honolulu
there is a large number of churches, Congregational, Roman Catholic,
Episcopalian, Methodist and Mormon. There is a Sunday law, and all
work which is not absolutely necessary is prohibited on that
day. Rational outdoor amusement is not prohibited, such as riding,
boating, shooting, etc., and the Government Band plays at the public
park at Waikiki every Sunday afternoon.</p>


<h3>PHYSICIANS.</h3>

<p>In every district of the Islands the Government supports a doctor,
who gives his services to indigent Hawaiians free of
<!-- Page 11 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
charge&mdash;others have to pay. In many places there are physicians
settled who carry on a private practice.</p>


<h3>TELEPHONES.</h3>

<p>The Islands of Oahu, Kauai and Hawaii have telephones to every
accessible point. The rent of the instrument is moderate, and a small
charge is made for those who do not care or cannot afford to possess
an instrument of their own. On Maui the telephone is at present
established only in part.</p>


<h3>COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE&nbsp;ISLANDS.</h3>

<p>Communication between the Islands is by steamer; of these some
seventeen are constantly plying from port to port, affording weekly
communication with the capital. The regular passenger steamers are
well fitted with cabins, have electric bells and electric lights and
all modern accommodations.</p>


<h3>POSTAL MATTERS.</h3>

<p>There is a regular postal system, and on the arrival of a steamer
at any main point, mail carriers at once start out to distribute the
mail through the district. The Hawaiian Islands belong to the Postal
Union, and money orders can be obtained to the United States, Canada,
Great Britain, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Hong Kong and Colony of Victoria, as well as local orders
between the Islands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<hr class="mini" />

<h3>AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES.</h3>

<p>The mainstay of the Hawaiian Islands has, for the last thirty-five
years, been the sugar industry. From this source a large amount of
wealth has been accumulated. But the sugar industry requires large
capital for expensive machinery, and has never proved remunerative to
small investors. An attempt has been made at profit-sharing and has
met with some success, the small farmer cultivating and the capitalist
grinding at a central mill. Of late years, moreover, the small farmer
has been steadily developing in the Hawaiian Islands and attention has
been given to other products than sugar.</p>

<p>Rice, neither the European nor the American can cultivate as
laborers.  It requires working in marshy land, and though on the
Islands it yields two crops a year, none but the Chinaman can raise it
successfully. A dry-land or mountain rice has been introduced, which
will be treated under the head of Agricultural possibilities.</p>

<p>The main staple after sugar and rice is coffee. Of this hundreds of
thousands of trees have been planted out within the last five years.
This is essentially the crop of the future and bids fair to become as
important a staple as sugar. Coffee does not require the amount of
capital that sugar does, and it can be worked remuneratively upon a
small area. It is estimated that at the end of the fourth year the
return from a 75-acre coffee plantation will much more than pay the
running expenses, while
<!-- Page 13 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
from that time on a return of from eight to ten thousand dollars per
annum may be realized.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_32">page&nbsp;32</a> will be found an estimate of the
cost of establishing a 75-acre coffee plantation from the first to the
seventh year.</p>

<p>Fruits can also be cultivated to advantage. At present the banana
trade of the Islands amounts to over 100,000 bunches per annum, valued
at over $100,000, and the quantity might be very easily quadrupled.
The banana industry may be regarded as in its infancy. The export of
the fruit is only from the Island of Oahu, but there are thousands of
acres on the other Islands of the group which could be profitably used
for this cultivation and for nothing else. The whole question of the
banana industry hinges on the market. At present the market is
limited.</p>

<p>Limes and oranges can be cultivated and the fruit can be easily
packed for export; at present the production does not meet the local
market.  The fruits can be raised to perfection. The Hawaiian orange
has a fine flavor and the Hawaiian lime has an aroma and flavor far
superior to that cultivated in Mexico and Central America. In the
uplands of Hawaii and Maui potatoes can be and are raised. Their
quality is good. Corn is also raised. In these industries many
Portuguese, Norwegians and others have embarked. Both these products
find an ample local market. The corn is used largely for feed on the
plantations. The corn is ground with the cob and makes an excellent
feed for working cattle, horses and mules.</p>

<p>In the uplands, where the climate is temperate, as at Waimea,
Hawaii, vegetables of all kinds can be raised; excellent cauliflowers,
cabbages and every product of the temperate zone can be grown to
perfection.</p>

<p>Cattle raising in so small a place as the Hawaiian Islands does not
present great opportunities except for local consumption. Pigs are
profitable to the small farmer. In the Kula district of Maui pigs are
fattened upon the corn and potatoes raised in the district. The price
of pork, dressed, is 25 cents per pound in Honolulu and about 15 cents
per pound in the
<!-- Page 14 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
outside districts. The Chinese, of whom there are some 15,000 resident
on the various Islands, are extremely fond of pork, so that there is a
large local market, which has to be supplemented by importations from
California.</p>

<p>Attention has lately been given to fiber plants, for which there
are many suitable locations. Ramie grows luxuriantly, but the lack of
proper decorticating and cleaning machinery has prevented any advance
in this cultivation.</p>

<p>Sisal hemp and Sansevieria<!--Typo: sanseveira--> have been
experimented with, but without any distinct influence upon the trade
output.</p>

<p>The cultivation of pineapples is a very growing industry. In 1895
pines were exported from the Islands to San Francisco to the value of
nearly $9,000. This has grown up in the last half dozen years. There
is every reason to think that canning pineapples for the Coast and
other markets can be made profitable.</p>

<p>The guava, which grows wild, can also be put up to profit, for the
manufacture of guava jelly. It has never been entered upon on a large
scale, but to the thrifty farmer it would add a convenient slice to
his income, just as the juice of the maple adds an increase to the
farmer of the Eastern States. Well made guava jelly will find a market
anywhere.  In England it is regarded as a great delicacy, being
imported from the West India Islands. Besides the guava there are
other fruits which can be put up to commercial profit, notably the
poha or Cape gooseberry (Physalis Edulis). This has been successfully
made into jams and jelly, which command an extensive local sale and
should find their way into larger markets.</p>

<p>In point of fact, outside the great industries of sugar, coffee and
rice, there is a good field for many minor industries which can be
carried on with profit by those who know what work is, and are willing
to put their shoulders to the wheel.</p>

<p>In the Hawaiian Islands a simple life can be lived, and entering
gradually upon the coffee industry, a good competence can be obtained
long before such could be realized by the agriculturalist
<!-- Page 15 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
elsewhere.  However, it is useless to come to the Islands without the
necessary capital to develop the land that can be obtained.</p>

<p>Between arriving and the time that the crops begin to give returns
there is a period where the living must be close, and cash must be
paid out for the necessary improvements. The land is here, the climate
is here; it only requires brains, a small capital and energy to
realize such comfort and independence as can not be realized in old
countries, in one-fourth of the time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<hr class="mini" />

<h3>COFFEE.</h3>


<p>The most promising of all the Island products, outside of sugar, is
coffee. No finer coffee in the world is produced than that of the
Hawaiian Islands. It requires care and does not produce a crop until
the third year, but it remains till the fifth year to make a proper
realization upon the investment. It is evidently necessary to give a
very full description of the coffee plant and its method of culture to
assure intending immigrants of what is before them.</p>

<p>Coffee is a shrub belonging to the family of the
Rubiaceae.<!--Typo: Rubiaciae--> Botanists divide it into many
species, but it can be practically divided into two sections, Arabian
coffee and Liberian coffee, or in point of fact, Asiatic and
African. In the Hawaiian Islands coffee grows best between 500 and
2,000 feet above the sea level, though there are cases in which it has
done well close to the sea. It requires a loose porous soil and does
not thrive well in heavy clayey ground which holds much water. Of such
heavy land there is very little in the Hawaiian Islands. The soil is
generally very porous.</p>

<p>It is very evident that coffee will thrive and give good results in
varying conditions of soil and degrees of heat. In these Islands it
grows and produces from very nearly at the sea level to the elevation
of 2,600 feet. The highest elevation of bearing coffee, known here, is
twenty-five miles from the town of Hilo and in the celebrated Olaa
district.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 17 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
</div>

<p>With such a range it is evident that, in a tropical climate, the
cultivation of coffee presents greater opportunities for an investor
than other tropical products.</p>

<p>For years it was thought that coffee would only grow to advantage
in the Kona district of Hawaii. Practical experiment has shown that it
can be grown with success in almost any part of the Islands.</p>

<p>The opening up of the Olaa portion of the Puna district, by a well
macadamized road leading from Hilo to the Volcano, may be regarded as
the commencement of the coffee industry on a large scale on the
Hawaiian Islands. There are now over fifty plantations where six years
ago there was nothing but tangled and dense forest. The Olaa land is
Government property and can be acquired under the land law. There are
still 10,000 acres not taken up. The location is very desirable as
there is direct communication with Hilo by an excellent road and the
crop can be readily taken to the shipping point. Indeed it can not be
long before a railroad will be built; when this takes place a far
larger extent of land will be available for coffee growing in this
section of the country. The soil in the Olaa district is deep and
wonderfully prolific.</p>

<p>Other portions of Puna also present many fertile lands, and coffee
plantations in those parts are coming to the front showing excellent
results. A considerable number of investors have opened up coffee
plantations in them, all of which are doing excellently. These
plantations, to the knowledge of the writer are, many of them, carried
on out of the savings made by workers in Honolulu, who are thus
preparing for themselves a provision for their early middle age. On
the Island of Hawaii are the great coffee districts of Olaa, Puna,
Kona and Hamakua, in each of which thriving coffee plantations are
established, while tens of thousands of acres of the very finest lands
are yet undisturbed. Government lands in these districts are being
opened up for settlement as fast as circumstances will permit.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 18 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
</div>

<p>On the Island of Maui there is a large area of splendid coffee
lands.  The extensive land of Keanae belonging to the Government will
be opened for settlement as soon as the preliminary work of surveying
is completed.</p>

<p>On the Island of Molokai the industry is making progress and there
are several plantations along the leeward valleys.</p>

<p>So also on the Island of Oahu there is much good coffee land, which
is being experimented upon, and considerable capital invested in the
undertaking.</p>

<p>As the case now stands for the investor, land can be obtained for
coffee growing in:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>In addition to the large tracts of Government lands on Hawaii and
Maui, there are many fine tracts of first-class<!--Add hyphen-->
coffee lands owned or controlled by private parties. It is the policy
of the Government to encourage the settlement of its lands by small
farmers. Hence the amount of land, granted to one party or that one
party can take up, while amply sufficient to enable one person or
family, with honest endeavor, to acquire an independence, is not large
enough to offer inducements for the employment of large amounts of
capital.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 19 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
</div>

<p>That areas of land, for the establishment of large coffee
plantations, can be acquired is reasonably certain as large owners are
evincing a disposition to sell and lease their lands.</p>

<p>There is no agricultural investment that offers better
opportunities for the profitable employment of capital, than a well
managed coffee estate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<hr class="mini" />

<h3>CULTIVATION OF&nbsp;THE COFFEE&nbsp;TREE IN&nbsp;THE
HAWAIIAN&nbsp;ISLANDS.</h3>


<p>In order to obtain the best results the coffee tree requires to be
properly planted, and during its life time needs frequent and
intelligent cultivation.</p>

<p>The various operations incidental to the opening and carrying on of
a coffee plantation will be taken up in their proper order and
described in as plain language as possible, and as briefly as is
consistent with a clear explanation of the subject.</p>

<p>The very first thing the planter should do after obtaining
possession of his land is to plant a nursery, so that he may have, as
soon as possible, an abundant supply of strong healthy plants. Many
planters have planted their fields with wild stumps, these are young
coffee plants that are found under wild growths of coffee trees. The
young trees are cut off about six inches above the ground, they are
then taken up and the lateral roots trimmed close to the tap root. The
thready end of the tap root is cut off and the stump is ready to
plant. In some cases the young plants are taken up, from under the
wild trees, and planted just as they are. This method can be dismissed
at once as the worst possible method of planting the coffee tree. The
very best plants are strong healthy nursery plants, that is, plants
that have been grown from the best seed in a properly prepared
nursery. The next best plants to use are nursery
<!-- Page 21 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
stumps. These are nursery trees that have grown too large to safely
transplant. By cutting them down and trimming the roots they can be
safely transplanted to the field, where they will grow into good
healthy trees. Stumps soon after planting send up several shoots,
these, with the exception of the strongest one, are taken off. This
latter shoot is to grow and make the coffee trees.</p>


<h3>MAKING THE NURSERY.</h3>

<p>The size of the nursery will depend on how large the plantation is
to be. For a 75-acre plantation, one acre of ground will more than
supply all the plants required. It is always desirable to have a
greater number of plants than is needed to just plant the acreage the
plantation is to be, for after the fields are planted some of the
plants may get injured from dry weather and require replacing with
plants from the nursery. Any surplus left, after the trees in the
fields are well established, can be sold to some later planter, who
will find it to his advantage to purchase good nursery plants for his
first planting and thereby save one year of time. It is advisable for
all planters to buy plants for their first planting, but for the
second year's planting they should have a nursery of their own from
which they can select the strongest and most forward plants.</p>

<p>The land for the nursery should be selected as close as possible to
where the plantation is to be. It should be on a slight slope to
insure drainage, and free from rocks and stones. The soil should be
ploughed or dug over to the depth of one foot and made as fine as
possible. Beds should be thrown up six inches high and three feet
wide. The surface of the beds should be made quite smooth and level;
the seeds should be planted six inches apart and three quarters of an
inch deep. A good way to ensure even and regular planting is to make a
frame three feet wide each way. Pegs, three quarters of an inch long
and five eighths of an inch diameter, should be fastened
<!-- Page 22 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
to one side of the frame, placing them exactly six inches apart. The
frame, thus prepared, is placed, pegs down, on the bed. A slight
pressure will sink the pegs into the soil.  The frame is now lifted
and you have the holes for the seeds all of one depth and equi-distant
from each other. The seeds can now be dropped one in each hole. The
seeds should be placed flat side down, and covered by brushing over
the surface of the bed. If the weather is at all dry it is a good plan
to mulch the surface of the bed with dry grass or fern leaves. The
soil should be kept moist, and if there is not sufficient rain the
beds must be watered. In six or seven weeks the seeds should sprout
and show above ground. The mulching should now be moved from over the
plants and arranged in the rows. It has been the practice of some
planters to plant the seed much closer than six inches apart, but it
will be found that plants at six inches apart can be more easily and
safely transplanted than from close planted beds. It will be advisable
in taking up plants from the beds, to take only every other one, this
will give the remaining plants more room to develop and grow more
stocky than would be the case if all the plants were taken up from
each bed as they were required.</p>


<h3>CLEARING THE LAND.</h3>

<p>The next thing for the planter to do is to get his land
cleared. This can be done more satisfactorily and cheaply by contract
than can be done by days' work. Gangs of Chinese and Japanese
undertake the clearing of land and will make a contract to clear the
land as per specification. In the Olaa District land costs from $20 to
$50 per acre to clear, according to the kind of clearing done. The
land is forest land and some planters have the trees cut down and
everything burned making the land quite clear, while others just have
the vines and ferns cut and the trees felled, leaving everything on
the land to rot.
<!-- Page 23 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
This method while costing much less than burning up everything, makes
it more expensive to lay out and plant the land. The planter must
decide for himself which of the two methods he will pursue. However,
it can be said in the case of those who only cut and fell, in a few
years everything, trees, vines and ferns rot down and greatly increase
the fertility of the soil. The next thing is to lay out the land for
the digging of the holes where it is intended to set out the young
trees. There is a wide diversity of opinion as to the proper distance
apart to plant coffee trees. From 10x12 feet down to 5x6 and all
intermediate distances are practiced. It is a significant fact that
planters who formerly planted their trees at the wider distances are
now setting out trees as close as 6x5. Trees planted 6x6 will probably
yield better results per acre than trees planted at a wider or closer
distance. Having fixed upon the distance apart the trees are to be
planted, the planter proceeds to mark with pegs the places where he
wants the holes dug. This is usually done with a line or rope that has
pieces of red rag fastened in the strands, at the distance apart at
which it is intended to dig the holes. The line is drawn tightly
across one end of the clearing and a peg driven into the soil at every
place that is marked on the line. The men, holding the two ends of the
line, are each provided with a stick the exact length that the rows
are to be apart. After one row is pegged, the line is advanced one
length of the stick and the operation repeated until the whole
clearing is pegged. After the first line is pegged a line should be
laid at exactly right angles to the first line so that the rows will
be straight both ways. The pegging being completed, the holes should
be dug not less than 18 inches wide and 18 inches deep. The top soil
should be carefully placed on one side of the hole and the subsoil on
the other, the holes should remain open as long as possible and should
only be filled in a week or so before planting the trees. The bottoms
of the holes should be explored with a light crowbar
<!-- Page 24 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
and, if any rocks or stones are found, they should be removed. In
filling the holes the top soil (that has been placed on one side)
should be placed in the bottom of the hole and other top soil should
be taken from between the rows until the hole is full, the subsoil can
now be disposed of by scattering it between the rows. The holes after
filling should have the marking pegs replaced in the center of the
filling, this will serve as a guide for planting the trees.</p>


<h3>PLANTING.</h3>

<p>There is no operation in all the work of establishing a coffee
plantation that requires such careful supervision as that of planting
out the young trees. If the work is carelessly done and the slender
tap root is doubled up or, if it is shortened too much, the tree will
never thrive. It may grow fairly well for a time, perhaps until the
time for the first crop, then the foliage will turn yellow and the
tree show every sign of decay. The effort to produce a crop is too
much for the tree and the sooner it is pulled up and replaced by a
properly planted tree the better.</p>

<p>The closest supervision is necessary in order that the planter may
be certain that the tap roots are placed perfectly straight in the
ground; and the lateral roots placed in a natural position. In order
to effect this, with the least amount of trouble, transplanters have
been used. A transplanter that has been used with success is made as
follows: two pieces of sheet iron (galvanized) are bent into two half
circles, which, when placed together, form a cylinder 3&nbsp;inches in
diameter and seven inches long. A piece of hoop iron is bent to a
ring, that will fit over the cylinder, and riveted. The mode of using
is as follows: The two halves of the cylinder are pressed into the
ground, one on each side of the young coffee tree. They are pressed
down until the upper ends are level with the surface of the soil. The
<!-- Page 25 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
hoop iron ring is then pressed over the ends of the two halves of the
cylinder, binding them firmly together. The cylinder can now be lifted
from the ground bringing with it the young tree with all its roots in
the position in which they grew. In this condition the young trees are
carried to the field and, the holes being opened, the cylinder,
holding the tree, is placed in the ground and the soil packed firmly
around it. The hoop iron ring is then removed and the two halves of
the cylinder withdrawn. The soil is again compacted around the roots
and the tree is planted. There is another transplanter, invented in
America, that would probably be better and more economical in working
than the one described above. This transplanter consists of a cylinder
of thin sheet steel. These are made in America of various sizes to
suit different kinds of trees. For a coffee tree a good size would be
7&nbsp;inches long and 5&nbsp;inches in diameter.  The cylinder has an
opening, five-eighths of an inch wide, running the whole length of the
cylinder and exactly opposite this opening a handle is riveted. This
handle is of half inch round iron, 18 inches long with a cross bar on
top. The rod is bent outward in the form of a bow, so that in working,
the branches of the young tree may not be injured. The mode of working
the transplanter is as follows: the cylinder is placed on the ground
with the tree in the center of the cylinder. This can be done by
allowing the stem of the young tree to pass through the slot in the
cylinder. Then, by means of the cross handle, the cylinder is turned
and pressed into the soil until the upper end is level with the
surface of the ground. Then, by lifting on the stem of the tree and
the handle of the transplanter at the same time, the tree is taken
from the ground with its roots undisturbed. Should the end of the tap
root project below the end of the cylinder, the thready end should be
pinched off with the thumb nail. By placing the lower end of the
cylinder on the bottom of a box and inserting a wedge-shaped piece of
wood in the slot, the cylinder is sprung
<!-- Page 26 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
open and can be withdrawn, leaving the young tree, with a cylinder of
earth around its roots, standing on the bottom of the box.  This
operation can be repeated until the box is full of the young trees,
when it is carried to the field and the trees placed one at each hole.
By using a duplicate transplanter a cylinder of earth is removed from
the spot where the tree is to be placed, and the tree with its
cylinder of earth is placed in the round hole, which it exactly fits,
the earth being slightly compacted around the roots. The tree is thus
planted with the absolute certainty that the roots are in their
natural position.</p>

<h3>WEEDING.</h3>

<p>The old adage, "a stitch in time saves nine," will bear its fullest
application in the care and weeding of a coffee estate. From the time
the land is first cleared, weeding should commence, and it is
astonishing how little it will cost if care is taken that no weed be
allowed to run to seed. The bulk of Hawaiian coffee lands is situated
in the forests where the land is covered with a dense undergrowth of
ferns and vines and there are no pernicious weeds to bother. But soon
after clearing, the seeds of weeds are dropped by the birds and are
carried in on the feet and clothing of the laborers and visitors. We
have no weeds that run to seed in less than thirty days, and if the
fields are gone over, once a month, and any weed that can be found
pulled up and buried, the work of weeding will be reduced to a
minimum. But if the weeds, that are bound to spring up, are allowed to
run to seed, the work of weeding will be greatly increased and will
require the labor of a large gang to keep the fields in order. If
taken in time, the labor of one man will keep from 15 to 25 acres
quite clean. During the first year after setting out the fields, all
that is required is to keep the fields clear of weeds and the
replacing, with a healthy tree from the nursery, any tree that from
any cause looks sickly and does not come along well.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 27 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
</div>

<p>It will be found that in parts of the field some trees, while
looking healthy, do not grow as fast as the average of the trees, this
is often due to the soil not being of as good a quality. Knolls and
side hills are not generally so rich as the hollows and valleys, and
the coffee trees, planted in the poorest parts of the field, should be
fertilized until they are as vigorous as the trees in the best
parts.</p>


<h3>HANDLING.</h3>

<p>During the second year the young trees will have begun to make a
good growth and will require handling. In order to make clear the
description of the operations of handling and pruning, it may be well
to describe here the component parts of the coffee tree.</p>

<p>The underground portion consists of a tap root and numerous lateral
or side roots. The parts above ground consist of:</p>

<p class="list">1st. The stem or trunk.</p>

<p class="list">2d. The primaries or first branches; these grow from
the trunk in pairs at intervals of from two to four inches, the two
primaries, making a pair, grow one opposite to the other, the pair
above radiating out at a different angle and so on to the top of the
tree.</p>

<p class="list">3rd. The secondaries; these are the branches that grow
in pairs from the primaries.</p>

<p class="list">4th. The tertiaries; these are the third branches that
grow in pairs from the secondaries in the same manner as the
secondaries grow on the primaries.</p>

<p class="list">5th. The leaves that grow on all the branches.</p>

<p>During the whole of the second year, the field should be gone over
at least every two months and all the secondaries that make their
appearance should be rubbed off; this can be done by a touch of the
fingers, if the secondaries are not more than two or three inches
long.  If allowed to grow longer, the knife
<!-- Page 28 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
must be used, or there is danger of tearing out the eye or bud, which
we depend upon for growing new secondaries at the proper time. During
the second year, the secondaries will make their appearance only on
the lower sets of primaries, the upper sets as they grow being too
young to grow secondaries. At the beginning of the third year all the
secondaries should be allowed to grow till they attain a length of six
inches; then the trees should be carefully gone over and all but five
of the secondaries on each primary cut off with a sharp pruning
knife. No pairs should be left, and only the strongest and most
vigorous should be retained. They should be disposed on alternate
sides of the primary and none left in a space of six inches from the
stem of the tree. The object of this is to allow the light to
penetrate to the center of the tree, for the coffee tree bears fruit
in greater profusion on branches that are exposed to the light than on
those that are shaded.</p>

<p>During this third year the tree will blossom and bear the first or
maiden crop. In some cases the tree will blossom in the second year,
but it is a wise plan to rub all the blossoms off, as it only weakens
the tree to bear a crop at such an early age. It is of the utmost
importance that in the first crop, as well as in all future crops, the
tree should not be overburdened with a superabundance of growing
wood. If left to itself, the lower primaries will grow a mass of
secondaries, so much so that no blossom will set on them, and the
first crop will come only on the upper primaries, and be only a third
or fourth of the crop that would be produced if the trees were
properly handled. By handling, as described above, the tree is
relieved of all superfluous wood and only such secondaries are left as
are needed to bear the fourth year's crop, and the maiden crop will
grow on the primaries. It may be well to mention here, that coffee
only grows on wood of the second year's growth, and does not grow on
the same wood twice.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 29 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
</div>

<p>During the third year, the secondaries will come on the upper
primaries.  When they are well set, they should be reduced in number
and in no case should more than five be left to grow. In some cases
four or even three will be sufficient. Whatever the number that may be
left, it must be understood that these are the branches that will bear
the crop for the fourth year. During the third year new secondaries
will grow from the places where the former secondaries grew. Sometimes
two will grow from one bud, they should all be removed, the trees
being gone over two months, but at the last handling before blossoming
time, which varies greatly with the elevation above sea level, enough
of these new secondaries should be left to make wood for the fifth
year's crop. From this time on the coffee planter should be able to
point out the wood on which the present and the next year's crop will
be borne, and it is this wood and that only, that should be allowed to
grow. All other shoots, suckers, etc., should be rubbed off each time
the tree is handled, provision being made each year for the wood for
the crop two years hence.</p>

<p>During the third year, the trees will require topping. As to the
height at which a coffee tree should be topped, there is a great
diversity of opinion. Some planters advocate topping as low as four
and a half feet, others at six or seven feet; as a matter of fact the
coffee tree will bear fruit if topped as low as one and one half feet
or if not topped at all. The only valid reason for topping as low as
four and a half feet is for the convenience of picking the crop. Five
and a half or six feet is a good height to top a coffee tree on the
rich lands of the Hawaiian Islands. In fact the planters should not be
guided by the number of feet, but by the number of primaries he
desires the tree to carry.  Eighteen to twenty pairs are a reasonable
number for a coffee tree to carry in this country, and it will be
found that by not counting those primaries that grow on the stem
within fifteen inches from the ground, eighteen or
<!-- Page 30 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
twenty pairs of primaries will come on the stem within six feet from
the ground. Before topping the tree, it should be allowed to grow
somewhat higher that it is intended to top, so that the wood may be
hardened and not decay as it sometimes does if topped when the wood is
too young. Topping is performed by cutting off the top of the tree at
a point an inch above a pair of primaries. Both primaries should also
be cut off an inch from the stem. This will leave the top in the form
of a cross; a knot will form at this point from which the tree will
constantly send up shoots striving to make a new top. These should be
torn off every time the tree is handled.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at the time when the tree is bearing the first
or maiden crop. Through careful handling the tree has been divested of
all superfluous shoots, branches, etc., and the crop is maturing on
the primaries. If the trees are situated on good rich soil, and the
trees are well grown, there should be at least thirteen pairs of
primaries bearing crop. At an average of fifty berries to each primary
there will be a yield of over one and a quarter pounds of clean coffee
to the tree.  This yield for the first crop has been much exceeded in
this country, but it can only be assured by careful cultivation and
handling as described in this paper.</p>

<p>We will now take a look at the condition of our three years old
trees.  They have all been topped and are carrying from thirty-six to
forty primaries, of which all except the upper six or eight are
carrying four or five secondaries that are well advanced and which
will bear the crop for the fourth year. There will also be four or
five secondaries, that are one or two months old, which are intended
to bear the fifth year's crop. All other growth should be removed as
before up to the time of blossoming for the fourth year's crop. This
may be estimated as follows: There should be at least twenty-four
primaries that have on each of them say, four bearing secondaries. At
thirty berries to each secondary, the yield would be close to three
<!-- Page 31 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
pounds of clean coffee to each tree. This again has been exceeded in
this country for four year old trees, but it must be borne in mind,
that in order to obtain these results, proper cultivation, handling
and pruning must be done. Without proper care such results would be
impossible, the coffee cannot grow an abundance of wood and coffee at
the same time. As soon as the crop of the fourth year is gathered the
work of pruning must commence without delay. This consists of cutting
off with a sharp knife the secondaries that have borne the crop. They
must not be cut so close as to injure the eye or bud. About
three-sixteenths of an inch from the stem of the primary will be quite
safe, and the secondaries for the fifth year's crop will soon make
their appearance. Care should be taken to leave the stem of the tree
clear of shoots and foliage for a space of six inches from the stem;
the tree will want all the light it can get. The coffee tree can be
said to be in full bearing when all the primaries are carrying bearing
secondaries.  During the life of the coffee tree, the planter must
keep a close watch on his trees and restrict their wood-bearing
propensities to the wood that is to bear his crops; nothing else
should be allowed to grow. If the work is commenced rightly and
carried on systematically, the work will not be difficult and no crops
will be lost. But on the other hand, if the work is neglected, the
trees will become matted and all the lower primaries die off. These,
if once lost, will not grow again. The tree under these conditions
will only bear a tithe of the crop it would bear with proper
attention, and furthermore it is a most difficult matter to bring a
neglected tree into proper shape and it can only be done at a loss of
one and perhaps two years' time. There are many minor details
connected with the care of the coffee tree which would occupy too much
space to describe here, and which the coffee planter can easily learn
as he carries on the work of coffee planting. Without doubt coffee
planting in this country is destined to become a great industry. We
have large tracts
<!-- Page 32 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
of the finest coffee lands in the world, only waiting to be cultivated
to make prosperous and happy homes. One parting word to the intending
coffee planter, take Davie Crockett's motto, "Be sure you're right and
then go ahead."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<hr class="mini" />

<h3>AGRICULTURAL POSSIBILITIES.</h3>


<p>While the coffee trees are growing and during the time that will
elapse before the planter receives returns from his investment, it
would be a wise thing for him to plant such things, as will not only
provide the greater part of the food for himself and family, but may
also yield a moderate return in money. The soil and climate of the
Hawaiian Islands will grow almost anything that grows in any other
country. All Northern fruits can be grown if one will only go high
enough on the mountain slopes of Maui and Hawaii. But the coffee
planter must confine himself to such things as will thrive in the
vicinity in which his coffee trees are planted, and it is for the
information of intending planters that this chapter is written.</p>

<p>In the first place, almost all kinds of vegetables will grow in
such profusion as will astonish those who have lived only in Northern
climes.  Green and sweet corn, potatoes, Irish and sweet, cabbages,
tomatoes, beans, lettuce, radishes and many other kinds of vegetables,
all of the finest quality and in the greatest profusion, can be had
every day in the year. Strawberries and raspberries can also be had
all the year round. In addition to oranges and limes, which grow to
perfection in this country, many fruits peculiar to tropical and
semi-tropical climates grow well and flourish in these Islands. Among
the more important is the Avocado Pear (Persea Gratissima), commonly
called the Alligator Pear. This tree grows well and bears fruit, of
splendid quality, in from 3 to 5 years from seed.
<!-- Page 38 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
The fruit is much esteemed by all classes. A small quantity of the
fruit is shipped to California; what reaches there in good condition
is quickly bought at high prices.  It can only be carried safely in
cold storage, and this is very expensive freight. A native peach does
well, and will bear fruit in two years from seed. The fruit is much
smaller than the American peach, which by the way does not do well on
elevations below 4000 feet, but very sweet and juicy and makes
excellent preserves and pies. Without doubt this peach could in a few
years be improved so as to rival peaches of any other country. The
Mango (Mangifera Indica) is a tropical fruit tree that grows in the
greatest profusion and bears enormous crops of delicious fruit. It
comes into bearing in 5 or 6 years from seed and does well from sea
level to an elevation of 2000 feet. The fruit is much liked by every
one; the green fruit is made into a sauce resembling, but much
superior to, apple butter.</p>

<p>The Guava (Psidium Guayava) grows wild in all parts of the Islands
below 3000 feet. The fruit, of which there is a great abundance, is
made into jam and the very finest jelly in the world. In the fruiting
season large quantities of the jelly can be made, and without doubt,
exported at a profit.</p>

<p>The Poha (Physalis edulis) is a quick growing shrub bearing a berry
that makes excellent jelly and jam. The shrub grows wild on elevations
between 1000 and 4000 feet. A patch of pohas planted in a corner of a
garden, will grow and yield a bountiful supply of fruit almost without
cultivation.</p>

<p>Pineapples are at home on these Islands; a small plot planted with
the best varieties of this king of fruits will keep the table supplied
the year round.</p>

<p>Another valuable fruit indigenous to this country is the Papaia
(Carica papaya). This fine fruit can be raised in enormous quantities
and is a most fattening food for pigs and chickens. The tree fruits in
eight or nine months from the seed, and thence forward for years it
yields ripe fruit every
<!-- Page 39 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
month in the year. The fruit is of the size of a small melon and is
very rich in sugar. The unripe fruit contains a milky juice that, even
when diluted with water, renders any tough meat, that is washed in it,
quite tender. A small piece of the unripe fruit placed in the water in
which meat or tough chicken is boiled makes it tender and easily
digestible.</p>

<p>A very valuable food plant, indigenous to these Islands, is the
taro (Colocasia esculenta). The variety known as dry land taro will
grow on land that is moist enough for the coffee trees. The taro is a
grand food plant, the tubers containing more nutriment for a given
weight than any other vegetable food. The young tops when cooked are
hard to distinguish from spinach. The tubers must be cooked before
they can be used for food, in order to dissipate a very acrid
principle that exists in both leaves and root.</p>

<p>Another important food plant that has been introduced and yields
abundantly is the Cassava (Manihot utilissima). This plant furnishes
the staple food for the population of Brazil. It is easily propagated
by the planting pieces of the woody portions of the stems and
branches. The tubers are available in nine or ten months after
planting. There are two kinds, the sweet and the bitter; the latter
being the more prolific. The sweet kind can be fed to pigs without
cooking. The bitter kind contains a poisonous substance which is
entirely destroyed by cooking. There is no danger of animals eating
the bitter kind in a raw state, for no stock will touch it, while the
sweet kind is eagerly eaten in the raw state by pigs, horses, cows,
etc. The tubers are prepared for human food by grating them. The juice
is then expelled by pressure, and the residue pounded into a coarse
meal, which is made into thin cakes. It is an excellent food, and said
to be much more digestible than bread and other foods made from
wheat. Pigs can be very cheaply raised on the sweet variety of this
plant. A field of the plant being ready
<!-- Page 40 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
to gather, a portion is fenced off, and the pigs turned into it. They
will continue to feed until every vestige of the tubers is eaten,
leaving the ground in a fine condition for replanting. The tubers
never spoil in the ground, in fact the soil is the very best
storehouse for them. However if left for two or three years the tubers
grow very large and tough.</p>

<p>Bananas, in great variety, are grown in all parts of the Islands
where there is sufficient moisture. Any land that will grow coffee
will grow bananas. The yield of fruit from this remarkable plant is
something astonishing. It commences to bear fruit in a little over one
year from the time of planting. The stem decays after the formation of
a bunch of fruit; this will weigh from 50 to 100 pounds and
upwards. Numerous suckers spring up from around the decaying stem and
bear fruit in their turn. One-half an acre planted with bananas would
not only furnish a large family with an abundance of delicious and
nutritious fruit, but would also yield a large supply of feed for
pigs, chickens and other stock.</p>

<p>The tea plant (Camellia Thea) grows well in this country and yields
a tea of good quality. It is hardly likely that it will become an
article of export from this country, as we cannot compete with the
very low prices paid for labor in the great tea countries, India,
Ceylon, and China. But it can be grown for home consumption, and there
is no reason why every coffee planter should not have a patch of tea
growing on his land. An eighth of an acre, planted out in tea plants,
would yield more tea than could be consumed by a large family; the
work of cultivation and preparation is light and easy and could be
done by women and children.</p>

<p>The coffee lands are situated in forested tracts in which there is
little or no pasturage for animals. Every coffee planter should keep
one or more cows to obtain the milk and butter which will furnish a
large addition to the food supply for himself and family. In order to
do this, it will be necessary to
<!-- Page 41 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
plant such things as will furnish food for the animals. We have
several fodder plants that will yield a large quantity of feed and
which will only grow in tropical and semi-tropical countries.</p>

<div class="illo">

</span></div>


<p>First among these is the Teosinte Reana (Euchlacna luxurians). This
plant is a native of Guatamala,<!--[sic]--> and grows splendidly in
this country; each plant requires sixteen feet of ground for its full
development. It is an annual if allowed to run to seed; but its growth
can be continued by cutting when four or five feet high, and green
feed obtained all the year round.</p>

<p>Guinea grass (Panicum Maximum), one of the grandest of fodder
plants, has been introduced and finds a congenial home in this
country. It is purely a tropical grass, it grows to a height of eight
feet forming large bunches which, when cut young, furnish an abundance
of sweet and tender feed. In districts when there is sufficient
moisture, it can be cut every two months. Caffir corn, Egyptian millet
and Sorghum grow well, and should be planted in order to have a change
of feed.</p>

<p>Pumpkins and squash grow to an enormous size and yield an immense
quantity of feed, much relished by cows and pigs.</p>

<p>A dry land rice is being tried in the coffee districts of Olaa and
Kona, on the Island of Hawaii, and there is every reason to believe
that it will be successful. Nearly all the laborers on the coffee
plantations use rice as their staple food and it has to be brought
from the Island of Oahu to the Islands of Hawaii and Maui. There is no
doubt but that the rice used by the labor on the coffee plantations,
can be raised on the spot, reducing the cost of living to the
laborers, and making them more contented.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the foregoing that many things can be grown
that will enable the coffee planter to not only reduce the outlay for
living expenses for himself and family but will also allow them to
enjoy many of the comforts and luxuries of life.</p>

<p>While our main industries, sugar, coffee and rice, are being
vigorously carried on, new products are not lost sight of. Experiments
<!-- Page 42 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
are in progress that promise to greatly diversify our industries and
increase the number of our exports.</p>

<p>Several fiber plants are receiving attention, particularly the
Sisal Hemp (Agave Sisalana) and Sansevieria or bow string Hemp. The
Sisal plant will grow and flourish on lands that are too dry for any
other cultivation. Many thousands of the plants have been introduced
and at least one plantation is being set out.</p>

<p>The bow string Hemp requires a wet, rich land in order to do
well. It probably yields the best fiber of all the leaf fiber
plants.</p>

<p>Ramie (Boehmeria nivea) grows splendidly in this country and after
being well established will yield 4 to 6 crops per annum. Whenever a
machine is invented that will economically decorticate the Ramie
fiber, its cultivation will become an important industry in this
country. Ramie will grow and do well wherever the coffee tree will
grow, and whenever the machine is available, the coffee planter will
have a profitable industry, to go hand in hand with coffee and employ
the slack time between the coffee picking seasons.</p>

<p>Cocoa (Theobroma Cacao) is the tree that<!--Typo: the--> produces
the fruit from which chocolate is made. It grows and bears well in
moist humid districts, and many of the coffee planters are setting out
numbers of the trees.</p>

<p>There are many other economic plants that are well suited for
culture in this country. The country is entering on a new era, and as
the lands become settled and population increases, many small cultures
will become possible, which will afford many persons the opportunity
of making an easy living in a land of eternal summer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<hr class="mini" />

<h3>DIGEST OF THE LAND&nbsp;ACT OF&nbsp;1895.</h3>

<h4>(With reference to unoccupied&nbsp;lands.)</h4>


<p>The Land Act of 1895, having for its special object the settlement
and cultivation of the Government agricultural and pastoral land,
vested the control and management of Public Lands in a Board of Three
Commissioners, composed of the Minister of the Interior and two
persons appointed and removable by the President, one of whom is
designated the Agent of Public Lands; but excepting from the control
of the Commissioners, town lots, landings, tracts reserved for Public
purposes, etc., which remain under the control of the Minister of the
Interior.</p>

<p class="smallskip">For the purposes of the Act, the Republic of
Hawaii is divided into Six Land Districts, as follows:</p>

<p class="list">1st. Hilo and Puna on the Island of Hawaii.</p>

<p class="list">2d. Hamakua and Kohala on the Island of Hawaii.</p>

<p class="list">3rd. Kona and Kau on the Island of Hawaii.</p>

<p class="list">4th. The Islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe.</p>

<p class="list">5th. The Island of Oahu.</p>

<p class="list">6th. The Island of Kauai.</p>


<p>The Commissioners are represented by a Sub-Agent in each District.</p>

<p class="smallskip">Public Lands for the purposes of this Act are
classified as follows:</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 44 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
</div>

<p class="list">I. Agricultural Lands. First Class: Land suitable for
the cultivation of Fruit, Coffee, Sugar or other perennial crops with
or without irrigation.</p>

<p class="list">Second Class: Land suitable for the cultivation of
annual crops only.</p>

<p class="list">Third Class: Wet lands such as kalo and rice
lands.</p>

<p class="list">II. Pastoral Land. First Class: Land not in the
description of Agricultural land but capable of carrying livestock the
year through.</p>

<p class="list">Second Class: Land capable of carrying livestock only
part of the year, or otherwise inferior to First Class Pastoral
land.</p>

<p class="list">III. Pastoral Agricultural Land: Land adapted in part
for pasturage and in part for cultivation.</p>

<p class="list">IV. Forest Land: Land producing forest trees but
unsuitable for cultivation.</p>

<p class="list">V. Waste Land. Land not included in the other
classes.</p>


<p class="smallskip">The Act provides three principal methods for the
acquirement of Public Lands, under systems known as
</p>

<p class="list">I. Homestead Lease.</p>

<p class="list">II. Right of Purchase Lease.</p>

<p class="list">III. Cash Freehold.</p>

respective systems.</p>


<h3>HOMESTEAD LEASE SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>The Homestead Lease system permits the acquirement of Public Land
by qualified persons without other payments than
<!-- Page 45 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
a fee of two dollars upon application and a fee of five dollars upon
issuance of Homestead Lease.</p>

<p class="smallskip">The limit of area in the different classes of
land which may be acquired under Homestead Lease is:</p>

<p class="list">8 acres first-class agricultural land;</p>

<p class="list">16 acres second-class agricultural land;</p>

<p class="list">1 acre wet (rice or taro) land;</p>

<p class="list">30 acres first-class pastoral land;</p>

<p class="list">60 acres second-class pastoral land;</p>

<p class="list">45 acres pastoral-agricultural land.</p>


<h3>SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS OF APPLICANTS FOR HOMESTEAD&nbsp;LEASE.</h3>

<p>Any person having the general qualifications (as to citizenship,
etc.)  who is not the owner in his own right of any land in the
Hawaiian Islands, other than "wet land" (rice, taro, etc.) and who is
not an applicant for other land under the Act may apply under this
part of the Act, and such application may cover one lot of wet land in
addition to other land, if reasonably near. Husband and wife may not
both be applicants.</p>

<p>Applications must be made in person at the office of Sub-Agent of
the District, accompanied by sworn declaration of qualifications, and
a fee of $2.</p>


<h3>CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPATION.</h3>

<p>The successful applicant receives a certificate of occupation which

<h3>CONDITIONS OF HOMESTEAD&nbsp;LEASE.</h3>

<p>The Lessee or his successors must maintain his home on the leased
premises, must pay the taxes assessed upon the premises, within sixty
days after the same are delinquent, and perform any conditions of the
lease relating to protection or planting of trees, or destruction and
prevention of vegetable pests.</p>

<p>Lands held under a certificate of occupation or homestead lease are
liable to taxation as estates in fee.</p>

<p>In case of the death of an occupier or lessee his interests,
notwithstanding any devise or bequest shall vest in his relations, in
the order prescribed in the Act, the widow or widower being first in
order, then the children, etc.</p>

<p>Certificates of occupation or homestead lease, or any interest
thereunder, is not assignable by way of mortgage nor is the same
subject to attachment, levy or sale on any process issuing from the
Courts of the country. Neither the whole nor any portion of the
premises may be sub-let.</p>

<p>Surrender may be made to the Government by an occupier or lessee
having the whole interest if all conditions to date of surrender have
been fulfilled, and the person so surrendering is entitled to receive
from the Government the value of permanent improvement, whenever the
same is received by the Government from a new tenant.</p>

</div>

<h3>CASH FREEHOLDS.</h3>

<p>Cash Freehold Lots are sold at auction to the highest qualified
bidder, at appraised value as upset price.</p>

<p>The qualification of applicants for Cash Freeholds and the areas of
land which may be acquired are the same as those under Right of
Purchase lease system.</p>


<h3>APPLICATIONS.</h3>

<p>Applications must be made to Sub-Agent of District in writing with
sworn declaration as to qualifications, and a fee of ten per cent. of
appraised value of lot, which fee is forfeited if applicant declines
to take the premises at the appraised value, and is credited to him if
he becomes the purchaser of the lot. If such applicant, however, is
outbid, his fee is returned to him.</p>

<p>If two or more applications are made and there is no bid above the
upset price, the first application takes precedence.</p>

<p>The purchaser at auction sale must pay immediately thereafter
one-fourth of purchase price and thereupon receive a "Freehold
Agreement."</p>


<h3>CONDITIONS OF FREEHOLD AGREEMENT.</h3>

<p>The freeholder shall pay the balance of purchase price in equal
installments in one, two and three years, with interest at 6 per cent.,
but may pay any installment before it is due and stop corresponding
interest.</p>

<p>Twenty-five per cent. of agricultural land must be cultivated, and
pastoral land fenced before the end of third year.</p>

<p>Freeholder must maintain his home on the premises, from end of first to
end of third year.</p>

<p>He may not assign or sub-let without consent of Agent of Public
Lands.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 50 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
</div>

<p>He must allow Agents of the Government to enter and examine the
premises.</p>

<p>He must pay all taxes that may be due upon the premises.</p>

<p>If all conditions are fulfilled he is entitled at end of three
years to Patent giving fee simple title.</p>

<p>In case of forfeiture or surrender the land and permanent
improvements are reappraised separately, and the value of such
improvements when received by Government from new tenant or
freeholder, will be paid to surrendering freeholder.</p>


<h3>SETTLEMENT ASSOCIATIONS.</h3>

<p>Six or more qualified persons may form a "Settlement Association"
and apply for holdings in one block.</p>

<p>The provisions for cash freehold apply to the settlement of such
blocks, but first auction sale is confined to members of such
Settlement Association.</p>

<p>Any lot in such block which may be forfeited or surrendered, or
which is not taken up by any member of the Settlement Association,
within three months, shall be open to any qualified applicants.</p>

<p>Disputes, disagreements or misunderstandings, between the parties
to certificate of occupation, homestead lease, right of purchase
lease, or cash freehold and relating thereto, which can not be
amicably settled, shall be submitted to the Circuit Judge in whose
jurisdiction the premises are situated and his decision shall be final
subject only to appeal to Supreme Court.</p>


<h3>CASH SALES AND SPECIAL&nbsp;AGREEMENTS.</h3>

<p>With consent of Executive Council, public lands not under lease may
be sold in parcels of not over one thousand acres, at public auction
for cash, and upon such sale and payment of full consideration, a land
patent will issue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<hr class="mini" />

<h4>POPULATION.</h4>

<p>The population of the Islands according to the census of 1890 was
89,991, or in round numbers 90,000. A census of the population has
just been taken, but the results cannot be exactly known for some
months. An estimate recently made based upon the knowledge of general
increase from various sources gives the population as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table summary="population by ethnicity">
<tr>
  <td class="left">Hawaiians</td>
  <td class="padright">35,000</td>

<tr>

</tr>

<tr>
  <td class="left" style="text-indent: 0.5em">Total</td>
  <td class="padright">107,000</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Since the census returns began to come in, it is very evident that
this estimate will be exceeded by some 2,000, making the total
population 109,000. The increase will probably be found among Japanese
and Portuguese. The population of Honolulu is 29,920, or practically
30,000.</p>


<h4>SHIPPING.</h4>

<p>The vessels flying the Hawaiian flag number 52, aggregating 21,678
tons.  They are divided as follows:</p>

</table>
</div>

<p>Of these vessels 13 are employed in foreign trade and 39 in trade
between the Islands.</p>


<h4>FINANCES.</h4>

<p>Mention has been made of the taxes of this country. A few words
will be to the point upon the financial condition of the
government.</p>

<p>The direct taxes yielded, in 1895, $592,691.92. The Customs revenue
was $547,149.04 and licenses,&nbsp;&amp;c., produced $600,224.23, in
all $1,740,065.19.</p>

<p>The current expenditures are kept within the current income. Great
public improvements are provided for by loan. This is what every
growing country has to do. The public debt of the country on January
1, 1896, was $3,764,335. With a population of 109,000, this gives
about $34 per head of the population. The Hawaiian Government finds no
difficulty in obtaining means for internal improvements, and a scheme
is now on foot to reduce the interest and consolidate the public
debt.</p>

<p>The exports in 1895 amounted to $8,474,138.15 and the imports to
$5,339,785.04. This certainly shows well for a country whose total
population is exceeded by dozens of cities. Of the exports
$7,975,590.41 were accredited to sugar, $22,823.68 to coffee,
$102,599.25 to bananas and $8,783.84 to pineapples. These three latter
items are elastic and the showing of 1896 will give a very large
increase in their yields.</p>

<p>Of the imports $4,121,920.22 came from the Pacific ports of the
United States and $394,399.16 from the Atlantic ports; a total of
$4,516,319.38, leaving but $1,197,698.16 for every other nation that
the country has commercial relations with.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 54 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
</div>

<p>In point of fact, taking exports and imports, the business in 1895
done by the Hawaiian Islands with all its commercial relations
amounted to $14,188,155.69; of this sum $12,908,508.92 was done with
the United States, which amounts to 91 per cent. of the whole business
of the Islands. From these figures it can be judged how prosperous a
little community that of the Hawaiian Islands is, and further how
close are its relations with the Great Republic. What country in the
world has 91 per cent. of its commercial relations with its
neighbor?</p>

<p>The financial condition of Hawaii is on a sound basis. The men in
charge of its government are frugal and careful of the public
expenditure, the whole tendency of the Republic is to foster industry
and thrift. The institutions are liberal and nothing is more desirable
for such a country than the immigration of colonists, with capital to
develop the industries and determination to work honestly and
well.</p>


<h4>FOR TOURISTS.</h4>

<p>It was not the intention when planning this pamphlet to speak of
the opportunities for tourists visiting the Islands, but a few words
are appended. The object of the pamphlet has been to show the
agricultural resources and general conditions.</p>

<p>The great attraction of the Islands is undoubtedly the Volcano of
Kilauea, the greatest and most striking volcano in the world. Though
quiescent for a time during part of 1895 and 1896, it has now burst
forth with renewed splendor and promises to exceed many of its former
efforts. Moreover, from the rising of the lakes of fire, and the floor
of the crater generally, it has evidently come to stay.</p>

<p>But it is not only this one great natural wonder that is attractive
to the tourist. The crater of Haleakala, the largest extinct crater in
the world, is almost, in its silent magnificence, equal to the wonder
of the boiling and seething Kilauea. Then the delightful climate, the
balmy breezes, the brilliant coloring
<!-- Page 55 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
of sky, sea and land, the luxuriant tropical vegetation, and the
peculiar "Dolce far niente" life, all lend a charm to which no one who
visits the place has ever failed to respond.  In fact a visit to the
Hawaiian Islands is one of the pleasantest experiences of a
life-time.</p>

<p>For people suffering from pulmonary troubles the climate is
unrivalled and there are now several sanitariums where such patients
can be attended to.</p>

<p>San Francisco and Victoria are the two points of deportation for
the Hawaiian Islands. The Oceanic Steamship Line has vessels sailing
twice a month. One steamer sails for Honolulu, stays a few days, and
returns to San Francisco. The other steamers touch at Honolulu and go
on to the Australian colonies. Round trip tickets can be obtained and
also lay over tickets, at the Company's offices on Montgomery street,
San Francisco. The Pacific Mail and
O.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;O. S.&nbsp;S. lines, running from China and Japan
to San Francisco, also touch at Honolulu regularly.  Arrangements can
be made to lay over in Honolulu, visit the Volcano and proceed on the
voyage by the next vessel.</p>

<p>From Victoria the C.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;A. S.&nbsp;S. sail once a
month. They give the tourist a chance of seeing the Canadian Pacific
Railroad before coming here, but a round trip ticket would have to be
for a full month. By the O.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S.  lines less time need be
spent on the Islands.</p>

<p class="list">The cost of round trip passage is $125.</p>

<p class="list">The cost of trip to the Volcano, including all
expenses is $50.</p>

<p class="list">Hotel expenses in Honolulu from $2 a day, according to
accommodation.</p>

<p>Particulars on these subjects can always be learned by writing to
Wilder S.&nbsp;S. Co., Fort street, Honolulu; or the Inter-Island
Steamship Co., Queen street, Honolulu.</p>

$6 per day; carpenters, $2.50 to $5; machinists, $3 to $5; painters,
$2 to $5, per day of nine hours.</p>


<h4>DOMESTIC LABOR.</h4>

<p>The domestic labor in Honolulu and in all parts of the Islands, has
for many years been performed by Chinese males, who undoubtedly make
excellent house servants. During the last four or five years the
Japanese have entered the field; the Japanese women are especially in
demand as nurses for children.</p>

<p class="list">The following are the prevailing rates of wages:</p>

<p class="list">Cooks, Chinese and Japanese, $3 to $6 per week, with
board and room.</p>

<p class="list">Nurses and house servants, $8 to $12 per month, with
board and room.</p>

<p class="list">Gardeners or yard men, $8 to $12 per month, with board
and room.</p>

<p class="list">Sewing women, $1 per day and one meal.</p>

<p>Good substantial meals can be obtained at respectable Chinese
restaurants and at the Sailors' Home for 25 cents or Board for $4.50
per week.</p>

<p>The market for all kinds of labor is overstocked and it would be
very unwise for any one to come to these Islands with no capital on
the mere chance of obtaining employment. The many steamships arriving
at this port bring numbers of people seeking employment who are
obliged to return disappointed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<hr class="mini" />

<h3>HISTORICAL SKETCH.</h3>

<p>Although the written history of the Hawaiian Islands begins with
their discovery by Captain Cook in 1778, yet the aboriginal
inhabitants had at that time an oral traditional history which
extended back for several centuries.</p>


<h3>ORIGIN.</h3>

<p>As to their origin, these people formed but one branch of the
Polynesian race, which at a remote period settled all the groups of
islands in the central and Eastern Pacific, as far as New Zealand in
the South and Easter Island in the East. This is shown by the close
physical and moral resemblance between their inhabitants, as well as
by the facts that they all speak dialects of the same language, and
have the same manners and customs, the same general system of
tabus,<!--[sic]--> and similar traditions and religious rites.</p>

<p>The evidence of both language and physical traits tends to show
that their remote ancestors came from the East Indian Archipelago, and
that they were still more distantly related to the pre-Arian races of
Hindostan.<!--[sic]--></p>

<p>It is also proved by concurrent traditions of the different groups
that there was a general movement of population throughout central
Polynesia during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries of the Christian
Era, during which the Harvey Islands and afterwards New Zealand were
colonized, and many
<!-- Page 59 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
voyages were made between the Hawaiian Islands and the Samoan and
Society groups. This intercourse, however, seems to have ceased for
four or five hundred years before the arrival of Captain Cook.</p>


<h3>ARTS AND MANUFACTURES.</h3>

<p>The ancient Hawaiians were not savages, in the proper sense of the
term, but barbarians of a promising type. When we consider that they
occupied the most isolated position in the world, and that they were
destitute of metals and of beasts of burden, as well as of the cereal
grains, cotton, flax and wool, we must admit that they had made a
creditable degree of progress towards civilization. Like the other
Polynesians, they had not invented the art of making pottery, or the
use of the loom for weaving.</p>

<p>Their cutting tools were made of stone, sharks' teeth or
bamboo. Their axes were made of hard, fine grained lava, chiefly found
on the mountain summits. Their principal implement for cultivating the
soil was simply a stick of hard wood, either pointed or shaped into a
flat blade at the end. With these rude tools they cut and framed the
timbers for their houses, which were oblong with long sides and steep
roofs, and were thatched with <i>pili</i> grass, ferns or <i>hala</i>
leaves. In the building as well as in the management of canoes they
were unsurpassed. For containers they used a large gourd (<i>cucurbita
maxima</i>, which was not found elsewhere in the Pacific), and also
cut out circular dishes of wood as truly as if they had been turned in
a lathe.</p>

<p>For clothing they beat out the inner bark of the paper mulberry and
of some other trees, until it resembled thick flexible paper, when it
was called <i>kapa</i> or <i>tapa</i>. For insignia of rank, they made
splendid feather cloaks, and feather helmets, which were worn only by
chiefs.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 60 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
</div>

<p>For lights they used the oily nuts of the <i>kukui</i> or
candle-nut tree.</p>

<p>For food they chiefly depended upon the tuberous roots of the
<i>taro</i> plant (<i>Colocasia antiquorum</i>), but sweet potatoes
were cultivated in the dry districts, and yams in Kauai and
Niihau. They also cultivated bananas and sugar cane and the <i>awa</i>
or <i>kava</i> plant for its narcotic properties.</p>

<p>Fishing was carried on with great ingenuity and skill. Extensive
fish ponds were built along the coasts, which must have cost immense
labor.</p>

<p>Their food was cooked then, as now, by steaming it in an <i>imu</i>
or underground oven with heated stones. Fire was produced by friction,
viz., by rubbing a hard, pointed stick in a groove made in a piece of
softer wood, until the little heap of fine powder collected at the end
of the groove took fire.</p>

<p>There was no circulating medium which served the purpose of money,
and all trade was conducted by barter.</p>


<h3>CIVIL POLITY.</h3>

<p>The civil polity of the ancient Hawaiians was far more despotic
than that of any other Polynesian tribe. The community was divided
into three classes, namely:</p>

<p class="list">1.&nbsp;The nobility or <i>Alii</i>
(N.&nbsp;Z. <i>Ariki</i>), comprising the kings and chiefs of various
grades of rank.</p>

<p class="list">2.&nbsp;The priests, <i>Kahuna</i>
(N.&nbsp;Z. <i>Tahunga</i>), including priests, sorcerers and
doctors.</p>

<p class="list">3.&nbsp;The common people, <i>Makaainana</i>, or
laboring class.</p>

<p>There was a wide and impassable gulch between the chiefs and common
people. In fact, the distinction between them was primarily of a
sacred and religious character. The chief was believed to be descended
from the gods, and to be allied to the invisible powers.</p>

<p>The contrast in stature and appearance as well as in bearing
between the chiefs and common people was very striking. Only
<!-- Page 61 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
a chief had the right to wear the feather cloak and helmet, or the
ivory clasp, <i>Niho Palaoa</i>; his canoe and his sails were painted
red, and on state occasions he was attended by men carrying
<i>kahilis</i> or plumed staffs of various colors.  When the highest
chiefs appeared abroad, all the common people prostrated themselves
with their faces upon the ground. It was death for a common man to
remain standing at the mention of the king's name in song, or when the
king's food, water or clothing was carried past; to put on any article
of dress belonging to him, to enter his enclosure without permission,
or to cross his shadow or that of his house. If a common man entered
the dread presence of the sovereign, he must crawl prone on the
ground, <i>kolokolo</i>, and leave in the same manner.</p>

<p>The head chief of an island was styled the <i>Moi</i>, and his
dignity was generally hereditary. There were usually at least four
independent kinglets in the group, and sometimes the single Island of
Hawaii was divided between several independent chiefs.</p>


<h3>LAND TENURE.</h3>

<p>As a rule, the chiefs were the only proprietors of the soil. They
were supposed to own not only the soil and all that grew upon it, not
only the fish of the sea, but also the time and labor of their
people.</p>

<p>The accepted theory was that all the lands belonged to the king, of
whom they were held by the high chiefs in fief; <i>i. e.</i>, on
condition of rendering him tribute and military service. Each of these
district chieftains divided up his territory among an inferior order
of petty chiefs, who owed to him the same service and obedience that
he owed to the king.</p>

<p>In this way the land was subdivided again and again, while at the
bottom of the scale were the miserable serfs who tilled the
soil. These last were simply tenants at will, liable to be
dispossessed
<!-- Page 62 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of their little holdings at any time, or to be stripped of their
personal property at the requisition of the chief.</p>


<h3>WAR.</h3>

<p>Wars were frequent and cruel. There were numerous wars to settle
the succession to the sovereignty of an Island, as well as contests
between the head chiefs of the principal Islands. For example, the
chiefs of Oahu often contended with those of Maui for the possession
of Molokai, and there were frequent wars between the chiefs of Hawaii
and those of Maui for the district of Hana.</p>

<p>Their weapons consisted of long spears, <i>pololu</i>; javelins,
<i>ihe</i>; daggers, <i>pahoa</i>, and clubs made of hard wood. They
never used the bow in war, but slings made of cocoanut<!--[sic]-->
fiber or human hair were extensively employed. They used no shields,
but became wonderfully expert in catching or parrying spears thrown at
them.</p>

<p>Sometimes they engaged in sea fights, with large fleets of canoes
on each side. In general no quarter was given to the vanquished, but
there were certain sanctuaries called <i>puuhonuas</i>, which afforded
an inviolable refuge in time of war. Cannibalism was regarded by them
with horror and detestation.</p>


<h3>RELIGION.</h3>

<p>The religious system of the ancient Hawaiians was very similar to
that of other Polynesians. It consisted in a great measure of nature
worship.  To their minds all the powers of nature, especially those
that are mysterious and terrible, were conceived of as living and
spiritual beings. Thus the volcano, the thunder, the whirlwind, the
meteor and the shark were feared as being either the embodiment or the
work of malevolent spirits (<i>akuas</i>).</p>

<p>The four great gods, Kane, Kanaloa, Ku and Lono, who were worshiped
throughout Polynesia, originally belonged to
<!-- Page 63 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
this class, as is shown by the cosmogony of the New Zealand
Maoris. Among these four Kane held the primacy. The souls of great
chiefs went to his abode after death.</p>

<p>Pele, the dread goddess of volcanoes, and her numerous family,
dwelt in the crater of Kilauea, but also caused the eruptions of Mauna
Loa and Hualalai. In Hawaii she was feared more than any other
deity.</p>

<p>One large class of <i>akuas</i> were supposed to be incarnated in
certain species of animals, which were feared or believed to have a
supernatural character, as the shark.</p>

<p>Another class of deities, which included most of the professional
gods, consisted of deified spirits of the dead. The <i>Aumakuas</i>
were tutelar deities, attached to particular families, who were often
deified ancestors. Sickness and disease were generally caused by their
displeasure.</p>


<h3>CEREMONIAL SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>There were two hereditary orders of priests, endowed with lands,
who kept up the elaborate liturgy and ritual of the temples, and also
preserved whatever knowledge of astronomy, history, medicine, etc.,
had been handed down to them.</p>

<p>The tabu<!--[sic]--> system covered the entire daily life of the
people with a vast network of minute regulations and penalties. Thus,
it was tabu for men and women to eat together, or even to have their
food cooked in the same oven. Women were forbidden to eat pork,
bananas, cocoanuts,<!--[sic]--> or turtle and certain kinds of fish,
on pain of death. There were certain tabu days when no canoe could be
launched, no fire lighted, and when no sound could be made, on pain of
death. Even dogs had to be muzzled and fowls shut up in calabashes for
twenty-four hours at a time.</p>

<p>The human sacrifice was the crowning act of the ancient worship,
offered only on certain solemn occasions, and at the temples
(<i>Heiaus</i>) of the highest class.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 64 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
</div>

<p>Whenever a temple was to be dedicated, a new house to be built for
the chief, or a new war canoe to be launched, many of the people fled
to the mountains and lay hidden till the danger was past.</p>

<p>Besides the regular priesthood, there were many kinds of medicine
men, necromancers or mediums, sorcerers and diviners, who preyed upon
the superstition and credulity of their countrymen. The belief that
all forms of disease were caused by evil spirits, and their fear of
being "prayed to death" (<i>anaana</i>), kept the people in a state of
abject fear.</p>

<p>There is too much reason to believe that during several centuries
preceding the discovery of the Islands they had been deteriorating in
many respects. As the historian Fornander has stated:</p>

<p>"It was an era of strife, dynastic ambitions, internal and external
wars on each Island, with all their deteriorating consequences of
anarchy, depopulation, social and intellectual degradation, loss of
liberty, loss of knowledge, loss of arts."</p>


<h3>DISCOVERY OF THE&nbsp;ISLANDS.</h3>

<p>It seems to be almost certain that one Juan Gaetano, a Spanish
navigator, saw Hawaii in 1555 A.&nbsp;D. A group of islands, the
largest of which was called La Mesa, was laid down in the old Spanish
charts in the same latitude as the Hawaiian Islands, but 10 degrees
too far east.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth of January, 1778, Captain Cook, the great
navigator, while sailing due north from the Society Islands,
discovered the Islands of Oahu and Kauai. The next day he landed at
Waimea, Kauai, where he held friendly intercourse with the natives,
and afterwards laid in supplies at Niihau. He finally sailed for
Alaska, Feb. 2d. The Hawaiians looked upon him as an incarnation of
the god Lono, and upon his crew as supernatural beings. Returning from
the Arctic the following winter, he anchored in Kealakekua bay,
January 17th, 1779.
<!-- Page 65 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Here he received divine honors and was loaded with munificent presents
of the best that the islands could produce. By his rash and arbitrary
conduct, however, he involved himself in an affray with the natives,
in which he was killed on February 14th, 1779.</p>

<p>The spot where he fell is now marked by an appropriate monument.</p>

<h3>EARLY TRADERS.</h3>

<p>For seven years after the death of Captain Cook no foreign vessel
ventured to touch at the Islands. After that time many of the vessels
engaged in the fur trade on the northwest coast of America called at
the Islands for supplies on their way to Canton or ran down here to
spend the winter. Waimea, Kauai, and Kealakekua bay were the two
harbors most frequented by them. Fire arms, powder and shot were the
articles most in demand among the natives.</p>


<h3>THE RISE OF KAMEHAMEHA.</h3>

<p>At the death of Kalaniopuu, <i>Moi</i>, of Hawaii, in 1782, a civil
war broke out, which rent the Island into three petty sovereignties,
which were presently reduced to two.</p>

<p>The districts of Kohala and Kona were held by Kamehameha, a nephew
of the late king, while the other districts were loyal to his son,
Keoua.  After a sanguinary war lasting nine years (during which
Kamehameha had ravaged West Maui and conquered the district of
Hamakua), he became master of the whole of the Island of Hawaii by the
assassination of his rival, Keoua, at Kawaihae, in 1791.</p>


<h3>VISITS OF VANCOUVER.</h3>

<p>The name of Capt. George Vancouver is still cherished as that of a
wise and generous benefactor to these Islands. During his
<!-- Page 66 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
survey of the northwest coast of America in 1792-1794, he made three
visits to the Islands. He uniformly refused to sell fire arms or
ammunition to the chiefs, but gave them useful plants and seeds, and
presented Kamehameha with the first cattle and sheep ever landed in
the Islands. On the 25th of February, 1794, Kamehameha and his chiefs
voluntarily placed Hawaii under the protection of Great Britain, in
token of which the British flag was hoisted on shore at
Kealakekua.</p>


<h3>CONQUEST OF OAHU.</h3>

<p>After the death of Kahekili, the sovereign of the leeward Islands,
in 1794, a civil war broke out between his brother Kaeo and his son
Kalanikupule, in which the former was killed. Soon after Kalanikupule
treacherously massacred Captains Brown and Gordon, who had assisted
him in the late war, and seized<!--Typo: siezed--> their vessels in
the harbor of Honolulu.</p>

<p>Having put his guns and ammunition on board, he proposed to sail
immediately for Hawaii, in company with a fleet of war canoes, to
attack Kamehameha. But the English sailors who had been reserved to
navigate the two vessels, suddenly rose at midnight, recaptured them,
and sailed for Hawaii, where they informed Kamehameha of all that had
occurred.</p>

<p>Kamehameha saw that his opportunity had now come, and lost no time
in mustering all the war canoes and fighting men of Hawaii.</p>

<p>After overrunning West Maui and touching at Molokai, he landed in
Waialea bay, Oahu, in the latter part of April, 1795. There he spent a
few days in organizing his army before marching up the valley of
Nuuanu, where Kalanikupule had prepared to make his last stand. The
Oahu warriors were soon routed and pursued up the valley. Some of the
fugitives were hemmed in and driven over the "<i>Pali</i>," or
precipice, at the head of Nuuanu, a little north of the present
road.</p>

<p>This victory made Kamehameha master of all the Islands
<!-- Page 67 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
except Kauai and Niihau. With the exception of a short insurrection in
Hawaii, there was peace during the rest of his reign.</p>


<h3>DECREASE OF POPULATION.</h3>

<p>The decrease of the population during this period must have been
very rapid. Vancouver in 1792, Broughton in 1796, and Trumbull in
1801, were strongly impressed with the misery of the common people and
their rapid decrease in numbers. This was partly the result of wars,
but was still more due to the diseases and vices introduced by
foreigners. In the summer of 1804 a pestilence, supposed to have been
the cholera, carried off half of the population of Oahu. Botany Bay
convicts had introduced the art of distilling liquor before the year
1800, and drunkenness had become very prevalent.</p>


<h3>THE SANDAL-WOOD TRADE.</h3>

<p>During the first quarter of the present century the sandal-wood
trade was at its height. This wood was in great request at Canton,
where it was sold for incense and the manufacture of fancy
articles. It was purchased by the picul of 133-1/2 pounds, the price
varying from eight to ten dollars for the picul. This wood, while it
lasted, was a mine of wealth for the chiefs, by means of which they
were enabled to buy fire arms, liquor, boats and schooners, as well as
silks and other Chinese goods, for which they paid exorbitant
prices.</p>


<h3>THE CESSION OF KAUAI.</h3>

<p>In March, 1810, Kaumualii, the last King of Kauai, visited Honolulu
in the ship Albatross, Capt. Nathan Winship, in order to have an
interview with Kamehameha. It was then arranged between the two chiefs
that Kaumualii should continue to hold his Island in fief of
Kamehameha during his life-time, on condition of paying tribute.</p>


<div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
</div>

<h3>RUSSIAN AGGRESSIONS.</h3>

<p>During the year 1815 a Dr.&nbsp;Scheffer was sent to the Islands by
Baranoff, the Russian Governor of Alaska. He built a fort at Waimea,
for Kaumualii, on which the Russian colors were displayed, and urged
him to place himself under the protection of Russia. On hearing of
this, Kamehameha sent a large force to Honolulu, where a substantial
fort was built during the year 1816. He also sent orders to Kaumualii
to expel Dr.&nbsp;Scheffer, which was done.</p>


<h3>DEATH OF KAMEHAMEHA.</h3>

<p>Kamehameha&nbsp;I. died on May 8th, 1819, at Kailua, Hawaii. His
work was done. He had consolidated the group under a strong
government, put an end to feudal anarchy and petty wars, and thus
prepared the way for civilization and Christianity.</p>


<h3>ABOLITION OF IDOLATRY.</h3>

<p>In accordance with his will, his eldest son, Liholiho, was
installed as king, with the title of Kamehameha&nbsp;II., and
Kaahumanu, his favorite queen, as premier, to exercise equal powers
with the young prince, whose dissolute and reckless character is well
known.</p>

<p>Their first important act was the abolition of the tabu<!--[sic]-->
system, which took place at a great feast held at Kailua in October,
1819, at which men and women ate together in public for the first
time. This was followed by the general burning of idols and temples
throughout the group.</p>

<p>Kekuaokalani, a cousin of Liholiho, put himself at the head of the
adherents of the ancient faith, but was defeated and slain in the
battle of Kuamoo, fought about December 20th, 1819.</p>

</div>

<h3>THE ARRIVAL OF THE AMERICAN MISSIONARIES.</h3>

<p>The pioneer company of American missionaries to these Islands
arrived at Kailua, April 4th, 1820. They soon reduced the language to
writing and commenced printing the first book in January, 1822. They
found in the Hawaiians an amiable and highly receptive race, eager for
knowledge and easily influenced for good or evil. The principal
opposition to reform was made by foreigners.</p>


<h3>THE WHALING FLEET.</h3>

<p>The first whale ship called at Honolulu in 1820, and was soon
followed by many others. Their number soon increased to 100 every
year, and the furnishing of supplies for them became the chief
resource of the Islands, as the sandal-wood became exhausted.</p>


<h3>DEATH OF LIHOLIHO.</h3>

<p>The young king, accompanied by his wife and six chiefs, embarked
for England, November 27, 1823, on an English whale ship. On their
arrival in London they received the utmost hospitality and courtesy,
but in a few weeks the whole party was attacked by the measles, of
which the king and queen both died.</p>


<h3>REBELLION ON KAUAI.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, on the death of Kaumualii, a rebellion broke out in
Kauai, led by his son, Humehume. A desperate assault was made on the
fort at Waimea, which was repulsed with loss. Over 1,000 warriors were
sent down from Oahu and Maui, and a battle was fought near Hanapepe,
August 18th, 1824, in which the rebels were routed.</p>


<div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
</div>

<h3>VISIT OF LORD BYRON.</h3>

<p>The frigate "Blonde," commanded by Lord Byron, cousin of the poet
of that name, was commissioned to convey the remains of the late king
and queen, together with their retinue, back to their native land. It
arrived at Honolulu, May 6th, 1825, when the royal remains were
deposited in a mausoleum with impressive funeral ceremonies.</p>

<p>Kauikeaouli, the younger brother of Liholiho, was proclaimed king
with the title of Kamehameha&nbsp;III., and Kaahumanu as regent during
his minority. Her administration was signalized by a series of
outrages at Lahaina and Honolulu, committed by a depraved class of
foreigners who resented certain regulations made to restrict public
prostitution.</p>

<p>Com.&nbsp;Jones visited the Islands in the "Peacock" in 1826, and
concluded the first treaty between the Hawaiian Islands and the United
States. The next year the first written laws were published against
murder, theft, adultery and gambling.</p>


<h3>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSION.</h3>

<p>The first Roman Catholic missionaries arrived at Honolulu, July
7th, 1827, on the ship "Comet," from Bordeaux, and soon gathered a
congregation. They were members of the so-called "Picpusian Order," or
"Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary." Unfortunately,
misunderstandings arose, and from a mistaken belief that they were
fomenting discord and sedition, the chiefs caused them to be deported
to San Pedro, California, in January, 1832.</p>


<h3>ACCESSION OF KAMEHAMEHA&nbsp;III.</h3>

<p>Kaahumanu died June 5th, 1832, and was succeeded by Kinau,
half-sister of the king. The king's minority was declared to be at an
end in March, 1833. A tract of land was leased to Ladd &amp; Co. in
1835, and about the same time a silk
<!-- Page 71 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
plantation was commenced by Peck &amp; Titcomb. Cotton was raised and
manufactured on a small scale at Kailua, Hawaii.</p>


<h3>PERSECUTIONS.</h3>

<p>During the next few years the chiefs persisted in a harsh and
unjustifiable policy, which imperiled the independence of the
country.</p>

<p>On the return of the two banished priests from California, in
April, 1837, they were ordered to return in the same vessel in which
they had come, and were obliged to go on board of it. Meanwhile the
British sloop of war "Sulphur," Captain Belcher, and the French
frigate "Venus," Captain Du Petit Thouars, arrived and interposed in
behalf of the priests. As a compromise, they were landed again on
condition that they should leave by the first favorable
opportunity. Again on the 3d of November, another priest,
Rev.&nbsp;L. Maigret, and a lay brother arrived from Valparaiso, but
were not allowed to land. Finally Revs. Maigret and Bachelot left in a
schooner for Bonabe, Micronesia. From 1835 to 1839 the persecution of
native converts was resumed, but was at last put an end to by the
declaration of rights promulgated June 4th, 1839, and the king's edict
of toleration, issued June 17th.</p>


<h3>VISIT OF THE "ARTEMISE."</h3>

<p>In consequence of these proceedings the French frigate "Artemise,"
Captain Laplace, was ordered to Honolulu, where it arrived July 9th,
1839.</p>

<p>Captain Laplace immediately sent the Government a peremptory letter
demanding that full religious liberty be proclaimed, and that the sum
of $20,000 be brought on board by noon of the 12th, or hostilities
would commence. The required treaty was signed and the money promptly
paid, and on the 16th, a commercial convention was also signed.</p>


<div>
<!-- Page 72 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
</div>

<h3>FIRST CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p>The declaration of rights, mentioned above, which guaranteed
religious liberty, produced a feeling of security unknown before, and
formed the first step towards establishing individual property in
land. The first constitution was proclaimed October 8th, 1840. It
constituted a Legislature, consisting of a House of Hereditary Nobles,
and Representatives to be chosen by the people, who voted as a
separate house. It also defined the duties of the Governors and
provided for a Supreme Court.</p>


<h3>THE FIRST EMBASSY.</h3>

<p>During the next two years the French and English consuls seemed to
vie with each other in the manufacture of petty grievances. Aware of
the dangers impending over it, the Hawaiian Government sent an embassy
to the United States, Great Britain and France, in July, 1842, which
consisted of Messrs. Haalilio, William Richards and Sir George
Simpson, one of the governors of the Hudson Bay Company.</p>


<h3>VISIT OF CAPTAIN MALLET.</h3>

<p>On the 24th of August, 1842, the French corvette "Embuscade,"
Captain Mallet, arrived at Honolulu, having been sent to investigate
complaints of the violation of the Laplace Convention, chiefly
relating to local school matters. Having received an able and
courteous reply to his demands, he informed the king that Admiral Du
Petit<!--Normalize DuPetit--> Thouars might be expected the next
spring to settle these matters.</p>


<h3>THE CESSION TO LORD&nbsp;PAULET.</h3>

<p>The dispatch of the embassy to Europe and the visit of Captain
Mallet both served to bring to a head the designs of
Mr.&nbsp;Charlton, the British consul. He suddenly left for London,
<!-- Page 73 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
leaving Alexander Simpson as acting consul, in order to defeat the
objects of the embassy. In consequence of their representations,
H.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;M. frigate "Carysford," commanded by George Paulet,
was ordered to Honolulu, arriving there February 10, 1843. On the
arrival of the king from Lahaina, Lord Paulet sent him six demands,
threatening war if they were not acceded to by 4 p. m. of the next
day. These demands chiefly related to a fraudulent land claim of
Charlton's, and to decisions of the courts in certain civil suits
between foreigners. Before the hour set for hostilities had arrived,
the king acceded to the demands under protest, and appealed to the
British Government for damages. But a fresh series of demands having
been made, and claims for damages having been trumped up amounting to
$80,000, the king decided, by Dr.&nbsp;Judd's advice, to forestall the
intended seizure of the Islands by a provisional cession, pending an
appeal to the justice of the home government.</p>

<p>The act of cession was carried into effect February 25th, 1843. The
British flag took the place of the Hawaiian for five months, and a
body of native troops was organized and drilled by British
officers.</p>

<p>The country was meanwhile governed by a mixed commission consisting
of Lord Paulet, Lieutenant Frere, a Mr.&nbsp;Mackay and
Dr.&nbsp;Judd.</p>

</span></div>


<h3>THE RESTORATION.</h3>

<p>On being informed of these events, Admiral Thomas,
Commander-in-Chief of H.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;M.'s naval forces in the Pacific
ocean, immediately sailed from Valparaiso for the Islands, arriving at
Honolulu July 25th, 1843. He immediately issued a proclamation,
declaring in the name of his government that he did not accept of the
provisional cession of the Hawaiian Islands, and on the 31st restored
the national flag with impressive ceremonies. His course was fully
approved of by the home government,
<!-- Page 74 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
and certainly tended to exalt the reputation of his country for
justice and magnanimity in dealing with inferior races.</p>


<h3>THE RECOGNITION OF HAWAIIAN INDEPENDENCE.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the Hawaiian embassadors,<!--[sic]--> who had been joined
by Mr.&nbsp;Marshall, the king's envoy, had done effective work in
London and Paris. At their request the matters in dispute had been
referred to the law advisers of the crown, who decided in favor of the
Hawaiian Government on every point except the Charlton land claim. At
length, on the 28th of November, 1843, the two governments of France
and England issued a joint declaration in which they recognized the
independence of the Islands, and reciprocally engaged "never to take
possession, either directly or under the title of a protectorate, or
under any other form, of any part of the territory of which they are
composed."</p>


<h3>ORGANIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT.</h3>

<p>Both the king and his advisers saw that in order to maintain a
permanent government it was necessary to combine both the native and
foreign elements together in one common organization, and to make the
king the sovereign not merely of one race or class, but of all. During
the next few years the executive departments of the Government and the
judiciary were organized by a group of men of remarkably high
character and ability.</p>


<h3>LAND TITLES.</h3>

<p>During the period of 1846-1855 the ancient tenure of land was
abolished, and the foundation laid of individual property in land. In
the first place, the king as feudal suzerain divided the lands of the
kingdom between himself and each one of the
<!-- Page 75 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
chiefs, his feudatories, this partition being recorded in a book
called the <i>Mahele</i> Book, or Book of Division. After this first
partition was closed, out of four million acres there remained in the
king's hands about two and a half millions.  The king then redivided
the lands which had been surrendered to him, setting apart about a
million and a half acres for the Government, and reserving for himself
as his private domain, about a million acres, including the best of
the lands. The common people were granted fee simple titles for their
house lots and the lands which they actually cultivated for
themselves, called <i>Kuleanas</i> or homesteads.</p>


<h3>THE "REPRISALS" OF 1849.</h3>

<p>From 1843 till 1848 the most amicable relations continued to exist
between France and the Hawaiian Government. But this state of things
was then reversed by M.&nbsp;Dillon, the new French consul, who
endeavored to reopen all old disputes and to create new grievances in
every possible way. His principal grounds of complaint were the high
duty on brandy and the alleged partiality shown to the English
language. On the 12th of August, 1849, the French frigate
"Poursuivante," Admiral De Tromelin, arrived at Honolulu, and was
joined the next day by the corvette "Gassendi."</p>

<p>On the 22d the admiral sent to the king ten demands, drawn up by
M.&nbsp;Dillon, allowing the Hawaiian Government three days in which
to comply with them.</p>

<p>As these demands were firmly but courteously refused, an armed
force was landed on the 25th, which took possession of the deserted
fort, the custom house and other buildings, and the harbor was
blockaded for ten days. The fort was dismantled and the king's private
yacht confiscated by way of "reprisal," after which the "Poursuivante"
sailed for San Francisco, taking M.&nbsp;Dillon as a passenger.</p>


<div>
<!-- Page 76 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
</div>

<h3>THE SECOND EMBASSY TO FRANCE.</h3>

<p>The king immediately sent Dr.&nbsp;Judd as special commissioner to
France, accompanied by the two nephews of the king, Alexander, the
heir-apparent, and Lot Kamehameha.</p>

<p>But on arriving in Paris they found that M.&nbsp;Dillon had
preceded them, and still retained the confidence of the Minister of
Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>The embassy, however, agreed with Lord Palmerston upon the basis of
a new treaty with Great Britain.</p>


<h3>THE U.&nbsp;S. PROTECTORATE.</h3>

<p>The French corvette "Serieuse" arrived at Honolulu, December 13,
1850, bringing M.&nbsp;Perrin, Commissioner of France, and remained in
port three months.</p>

<p>To the surprise of all, he presented again the identical ten
demands of his predecessor, and resumed his policy of petty annoyance
and interference with internal affairs of the kingdom. At length his
attitude became so menacing that the king and privy council passed a
proclamation placing the Islands provisionally under the protectorate
of the United States. This action was ratified by the next
Legislature.  Although it was finally declined by the United States,
it had the desired effect, and the obnoxious demands were dropped.</p>


<h3>THE CONSTITUTION OF 1852.</h3>

<p>Was a very liberal one for the times, and has formed the basis of
all succeeding constitutions. The nobles were to be appointed by the
kings for life. The representatives, who were to be not less than
twenty-four in number, were to be elected by universal suffrage.</p>


<h3>INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS.</h3>

<p>Between the years 1850 and 1860 a large part of the government land
was sold to the common people in small tracts at nominal prices.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 77 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
</div>

<p>The rapid settlement of California opened a new market for the
productions of the Islands, and gave a great stimulus to agriculture.
For a time large profits were made by raising potatoes for the
California market. Wheat was cultivated in the Makawao district, and a
steam flouring mill was erected in Honolulu in 1854. The next year 463
barrels of Hawaiian flour were exported. A coffee plantation was
started at Hanalei, Kauai, in 1842, and promised well, but was
attacked by blight after the severe drought of 1851-2. The export of
coffee rose to 208,000 pounds in 1850, but then fell off. The export
of sugar only reached 500 tons in 1853. The sugar mills were generally
worked by oxen or mules, and the molasses drained in the old fashioned
way.</p>


<h3>THE UNFINISHED ANNEXATION TREATY.</h3>

<p>The year 1853 was rendered memorable by a terrible epidemic of
small-pox, which carried off several thousand people on the Island of
Oahu. During that and the following year there was an active agitation
in Honolulu in favor of annexation to the United States. The king
favored it as a refuge from impending dangers. The missionaries
generally opposed it, fearing that its effects would be injurious to
the native race. The negotiations were carried on between
Mr.&nbsp;Gregg, the American Minister, and Mr.&nbsp;Wyllie, the
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and a draft of the treaty was completed
in June, 1854.</p>

<p>The representatives of France and Great Britain remonstrated with
the king against it, while the heir-apparent was also opposed to
it. The negotiation was still pending when the king suddenly died on
the 15th of December, 1854.</p>

<p>His adopted son and heir, Alexander Liholiho, was immediately
proclaimed king, under the title of Kamehameha IV.</p>


<h3>THE REIGN OF KAMEHAMEHA&nbsp;IV.</h3>

<p>Was uneventful. He was married to Emma Rooke, a chiefess partly of
English descent, who both by her character and her
<!-- Page 78 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
talents was worthy of the position. By their personal exertions the
king and queen succeeded in raising the funds with which to found the
"Queen's Hospital" at Honolulu. Their little son, the "Prince of
Hawaii," died in 1862, at four years of age, and with him expired the
hope of the Kamehameha dynasty. During the same year Bishop Staley,
accompanied by a staff of clergymen, arrived at Honolulu and commenced
the Anglican Mission.</p>

<p>During the following year the king was rapidly failing in health,
and on the 30th of November, 1863, he died, at the early age of
twenty-nine, and was succeeded by his elder brother, Prince Lot
Kamehameha.</p>

<p>The development of the country during his reign was nearly at a
stand-still. The cultivation of wheat as well as that of coffee was
given up, but the culture of rice was commenced in 1860, and proved to
be a great success.</p>


<h3>THE REIGN OF KAMEHAMEHA&nbsp;V.</h3>

<p>The reign of Kamehameha&nbsp;V. was memorable for the change of the
constitution which he made on his own authority, soon after coming to
the throne. The right of suffrage was made to depend on a small
property qualification and on ability to read and write. The Nobles
and representatives were henceforth to sit and vote in one
chamber. During his reign the Board of Education was constituted, the
Bureau of Immigration formed, and the Act passed in 1865 to segregate
the lepers.</p>

<p>A treaty of reciprocity with the United States was negotiated, but
failed of ratification by the Senate.</p>

<p>A destructive eruption from Mauna Loa took place in 1868, in the
District of Kau. The almost total destruction of the whaling fleet in
the Arctic Sea in 1871 was a serious blow to the prosperity of the
Islands.</p>

<p>The King died suddenly December 11th, 1872, and with him ended the
line of the Kamehamehas.</p>


<div>
<!-- Page 79 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
</div>

<h3>THE REIGN OF LUNALILO.</h3>

<p>As Kamehameha&nbsp;V. died without appointing any successor, the
choice devolved upon the Legislature, which met on the 8th of January,
1873, and elected William Lunalilo, cousin of the late king, by a
large majority, amid general rejoicing. During that year, the proposal
to cede or lease Pearl Harbor to the United States in consideration of
a treaty of commercial reciprocity gave rise to an extensive
agitation, which intensified the suspicion and race prejudice that
already existed.</p>

<p>The execution of the law for the segregation of lepers helped to
widen the breach, and the effects were seen in the mutiny of the
household troops in September, 1873, which had the sympathy of the
populace.</p>

<p>The King's health was already failing, and on the 3d of February,
1874, he died of pulmonary consumption. By his will he left the bulk
of his real estate to found a home for aged and indigent
Hawaiians.</p>


<h3>ACCESSION OF KALAKAUA.</h3>

<p>Again the Legislature was called together to elect his successor on
the 12th of February, 1874. The two rival candidates were the
Queen-Dowager Emma and David Kalakaua, the latter of whom was elected
by thirty-nine votes to six. A large mob, composed of Queen Emma's
partisans, surrounded the court house during the election, after which
they broke into the building and assaulted the members of the
Legislature.</p>

<p>At the request of the Cabinet, a body of marines was landed from
the U.&nbsp;S. ships "Tuscarora" and "Portsmouth," and another from
H.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;M.'s ship "Tenedos," which dispersed the rioters and
guarded the public buildings for a week. Kalakaua was sworn in at noon
the next day, and duly proclaimed King.</p>


<div>
<!-- Page 80 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
</div>

<h3>THE RECIPROCITY TREATY.</h3>

<p>During the next year negotiations were opened with the United
States for a treaty of commercial reciprocity, which was ratified in
June, 1875, and finally went into operation in September, 1876, in
spite of bitter opposition in both countries. The development of the
resources of the Islands, which has resulted from this treaty, has
surpassed all expectation. In connection with it there has also been a
large increase of the foreign elements in the population.</p>


<h3>THE KING'S TOUR AROUND THE&nbsp;WORLD.</h3>

<p>On the 20th of January, 1881, King Kalakaua set out on a tour
around the world, accompanied by the late Col.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;H. Judd,
and Mr.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;N. Armstrong.  He was received with royal honors
in Japan, and afterwards visited China, Siam, Johore and British
India. After visiting the Khedive of Egypt, the party made the tour of
Europe, and returned home by way of the United States, arriving in
Honolulu Oct. 29, 1881.</p>


<h3>REACTIONARY POLICY OF KALAKAUA.</h3>

<p>Unlike his predecessors, Kalakaua seemed to regard himself as merely a
king of the native Hawaiians, and foreign residents as alien invaders.
It also seemed to be his chief aim to change the system of government
into a personal despotism, in which he should have unchecked control of
the Government Treasury. Thus he took it upon himself in July, 1878, and
again in August, 1880, to dismiss a Ministry, without assigning any
reason, immediately after it had been triumphantly sustained by a vote
of the Legislature. On the latter occasion, his appointment of Celso
Caesar Moreno as premier called forth the protest of the representatives
of three great Powers, and such an uprising of the people that he had to
give way. Adroit politicians were not wanting to flatter his vanity,
defend his
<!-- Page 81 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
follies, and show him how to violate the spirit and intent of the
Constitution, while keeping within the letter of the law. The
Legislatures were packed with subservient office-holders, while every
artifice was used to debauch the native electorate and to foment race
prejudice. The national debt grew up from $389,000 in 1880 to
$1,936,000 in 1887. At the same time, under the existing law, no
foreigner could be naturalized without the King's approval.</p>

<h3>THE REVOLUTION OF&nbsp;1887.</h3>

<p>After the legislative session of 1886, the King was virtually his
own prime minister, and went from one folly to another, until his
acceptance of two bribes, one of $75,000 and another of $80,000 in
connection with the assignment of an opium license, precipitated the
revolution of 1887.  Overawed by the unanimity of the movement, and
deserted by his followers, the King yielded without a struggle. The
Constitution which he was pleased to sign on the 7th of July, 1887,
was a revision of that of 1864, intended to put an end to mere
personal government, and to make the executive responsible to the
representatives of the people.  Office-holders were made ineligible to
seats in the Legislature. The Ministers were henceforth to be
removable only upon a vote of want of confidence passed by a majority
of all the elective members of the Legislature. The Nobles, instead of
being appointed by the King, were to be elected for terms of six
years, by electors who should be possessed of taxable property worth
$3,000, or in receipt of an annual income of $600.</p>


<h3>THE INSURRECTION OF&nbsp;1889.</h3>

<p>The opposition of the Court and of other adherents of the old
regime, to the reforms of 1887, led to an insurrection headed by
R.&nbsp;W. Wilcox, on the 30th of July, 1889 which was promptly
<!-- Page 82 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
put down, but not without bloodshed. Seven of the rioters were killed
and a large number wounded.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the late King and his sister were
accessory to this ill-advised outbreak.</p>


<h3>ACCESSION OF LILIUOKALANI.</h3>

<p>In order to recruit his health, the King visited California in
November, 1890. In spite of the best medical attendance, he continued
to fail, and breathed his last on the 20th of January, 1891, in San
Francisco. His remains were brought to Honolulu in the
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. "Charleston," arriving there January 29th, 1891. On
the same day, his sister took the oath to maintain the Constitution,
and was proclaimed Queen, under the title of Liliuokalani.</p>


<h3>THE REVOLUTION OF&nbsp;1893.</h3>

<p>The ex-Queen in a published statement has since declared that she
signed the Constitution unwillingly. The history of her short reign
shows that it was her unaltered purpose to restore autocratic
government. In short, she was determined to govern as well as to
reign.</p>

<p>The decision of the Supreme Court that the term of the last Cabinet
expired with the King, gave her an opportunity (which she improved),
to dictate terms in advance to the incoming Cabinet, and to secure
control of all appointments. The legislative session of 1892 was
protracted to eight months chiefly by her determination to retain her
control of the Executive, as well as to carry through the opium and
lottery bills.  Meanwhile she had caused a Constitution to be drawn
up, which would practically, have transformed the government from a
limited to an absolute monarchy, besides disfranchising a class of
citizens who paid two-thirds of the taxes. This Constitution she
undertook to spring upon the country by a <i>coup d'etat</i>, on
<!-- Page 83 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the day of the prorogation of the Legislature, January 14th, 1893.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at the critical moment, when her preparations were
complete, her Ministers shrank from sharing the responsibility of such
a revolutionary act, and induced her to postpone it. In such an
undertaking to hesitate is fatal.</p>

<p>Again there was a general uprising of the conservative part of the
community similar to that of 1887. But this time public opinion
condemned all half way measures, and declared the monarchy to be
forfeited by its own act.</p>

<p>The Reform leaders reorganized their forces, and formed a
Provisional Government, which was proclaimed January 17th, 1893 from
the Government Building. The U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. "Boston," which had
unexpectedly arrived from Hilo on the day of the prorogation, landed a
force on the 16th, to protect the lives and property of American
citizens, in case of disorder or incendiarism. The Queen's ministers
availed themselves of the presence of these troops on shore as an
excuse for their inaction, and persuaded the Queen to resign under
protest, and to appeal to the government of the United States.</p>

<p>A treaty of annexation was soon after negotiated with the United
States during President Harrison's administration, which was withdrawn
by President Cleveland immediately after his accession. The failure of
his attempt to restore the monarchy by diplomacy is well known.</p>


<h3>THE REPUBLIC OF HAWAII.</h3>

<p>During the next year a convention was elected, which sat in
Honolulu during the month of June, 1894, and framed a new Constitution
for the country, and the Republic of Hawaii was formally proclaimed
July 4, 1894.</p>

<p>Another royalist conspiracy was formed during the fall of that
year, which resulted in the insurrection of January 6th,
<!-- Page 84 -->
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
1895, which was promptly crushed by the patriotic citizens of the
Republic.</p>

<p>A dangerous epidemic of Asiatic cholera in the following September,
was stamped out by the united efforts of the public spirited citizens
of Honolulu.</p>

<p>For four years, in spite of hostile influences from without and
enemies at home, the Republic has maintained peace and order,
administered justice, carried on extensive internal improvements,
advanced education, and kept the financial credit of the nation above
par in the markets of the world.</p>
